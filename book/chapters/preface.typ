#heading(level: 1, numbering: none)[Preface]

The purpose of this book is twofold: to explain to students why spectral methods work and why they are so efficient, and to teach them how to program these methods using modern tools.

This text is conceived as a collection of *Computational Études*. Just as a musical étude is designed to perfect a specific technique while creating something artistically whole, each chapter here presents a mathematical concept paired with its computational realization.

   abstract = {Powder-snow avalanches are violent natural disasters which represent a major risk for infrastructures and populations in mountain regions. In this study we present a novel model for the simulation of avalanches in the aerosol regime. The second scope of this study is to get more insight into the interaction process between an avalanche and a rigid obstacle. An incompressible model of two miscible fluids can be successfully employed in this type of problems. We allow for mass diffusion between two phases according to the Fick's law. The governing equations are discretized with a contemporary fully implicit finite volume scheme. The solver is able to deal with arbitrary density ratios. Several numerical results are presented. Volume fraction, velocity, and pressure fields are presented and discussed. Finally, we point out how this methodology can be used for practical problems.},

Here it is shown that the speed, energy and momentum of a steep solitary wave in water of finite depth all behave in an oscillatory manner as functions of the wave height and as the limiting height is approached. Asymptotic formulae for these and other wave parameters are derived by means of a theory for the ‘almost-highest wave’ similar to that formulated previously for periodic waves in deep water (Longuet-Higgins & Fox 1977, 1978). It is demonstrated that the theory fits very precisely some recent calculations of solitary waves by Tanaka (1995).},

Available results are briefly discussed with specific emphasis on the comparison between the Initial Value Problem and the BVP; the latter more completely representing the physical phenomenon of wave propagation on a beach. The solution of the BVP is achieved through a perturbation approach solely using the assumption of small waves incoming at the seaward boundary of the domain. The most significant results, i.e., the shoreline position estimation, the actual wave height and velocity at the seaward boundary, the reflected wave height and velocity at the seaward boundary are given for three specific input waves and compared with available solutions.},

@article{Wu1987,
   abstract = {This study investigates the recently identified phenomenon whereby a forcing disturbance moving steadily with a transcritical velocity in shallow water can generate, periodically, a succession of solitary waves, advancing upstream of the disturbance in procession, while a train of weakly nonlinear and weakly dispersive waves develops downstream of a region of depressed water surface trailing just behind the disturbance. This phenomenon was numerically discovered by Wu & Wu (1982) based on the generalized Boussinesq model for describing two-dimensional long waves generated by moving surface pressure or topography. In a joint theoretical and experimental study, Lee (1985) found a broad agreement between the experiment and two theoretical models, the generalized Boussinesq and the forced Korteweg-de Vries (fKdV) equations, both containing forcing functions. The fKdV model is applied in the present study to explore the basic mechanism underlying the phenomenon. To facilitate the analysis of the stability of solutions of the initial-boundary-value problem of the fKdV equation, a family of forced steady solitary waves is found. Any such solution, if once established, will remain permanent in form in accordance with the uniqueness theorem shown here. One of the simplest of the stationary solutions, which is a one-parameter family and can be scaled into a universal similarity form, is chosen for stability calculations. As a test of the computer code, the initially established stationary solution is found to be numerically permanent in form with fractional uncertainties of less than 2% after the wave has traversed, under forcing, the distance of 600 water depths. The other numerical results show that when the wave is initially so disturbed as to have to rise from the rest state, which is taken as the initial value, the same phenomenon of the generation of upstream-advancing solitons is found to appear, with a definite time period of generation. The result for this similarity family shows that the period of generation, Ts, and the scaled amplitude α of the solitons so generated are related by the formula Ts = const α−3/2. This relation is further found to be in good agreement with the first-principle prediction derived here based on mass, momentum and energy considerations of the fKdV equation.},

   abstract = {In this paper we review and re-examine the classical analytical solutions for run-up of periodic long waves on an infinitely long slope as well as on a finite slope attached to a flat bottom. Both cases provide simple expressions for the maximum run-up and the associated flow velocity in terms of the surf-similarity parameter and the amplitude to depth ratio determined at some offshore location. We use the analytical expressions to analyze the impact of tsunamis on beaches and relate the discussion to the recent Indian Ocean tsunami from December 26, 2004. An important conclusion is that extreme run-up combined with extreme flow velocities occurs for surf-similarity parameters of the order 3-6, and for typical tsunami wave periods this requires relatively mild beach slopes. Next, we compare the theoretical solutions to measured run-up of breaking and non-breaking irregular waves on steep impermeable slopes. For the non-breaking waves, the theoretical curves turn out to be superior to state-of-the-art empirical estimates. Finally, we compare the theoretical solutions with numerical results obtained with a high-order Boussinesq-type method, and generally obtain an excellent agreement},

So far no explanation has been substantiated to rationalize the transition process by which the steady unidirectional laminar flow state gives way to a temporally and spatially disordered three-dimensional (turbulent) solution as the flow rate increases. Recently, new travelling wave solutions have been discovered which are saddle points in phase space. These plausibly represent the lowest level in a hierarchy of spatio-temporal periodic flow solutions which may be used to construct a cycle expansion theory of turbulent pipe flows. We summarize this success against the backdrop of past work and discuss its implications for future research.},

   abstract = {Properties of internal wave fronts or Kelvin fronts travelling eastward in the equatorial waveguide are studied, motivated by recent studies on coastal Kelvin waves and jumps and new data on equatorial Kelvin waves. It has been recognized for some time that nonlinear equatorial Kelvin waves can steepen and break, forming a broken wave of depression, or front, propagating eastward. The three-dimensional structure of the wave field associated with such a front is considered. As for linear Kelvin waves, the front is symmetrical with respect to the equator. Sufficiently far away from the front, the wave profile is Gaussian in the meridional direction, with the equatorial Rossby radius of deformation being its decay scale. Due to nonlinearity, the phase speed of the front is greater than that of linear Kelvin waves, resulting in a supercritical flow. This leads to the resonant generation of equatorially trapped gravity-inertial (or Poincaré) waves, analogous in principle to the resonant mechanism for nonlinear coastal Kelvin waves. First-mode symmetrical Poincaré waves are generated, with their wavelength determined by the amplitude of the front. Finally, the propagation of a Kelvin front gives rise to a nonzero poleward mass transport above the thermocline, in consequence of which there is a poleward heat flux.},

A layer composed of fluidized granular material is assumed to flow within an upper layer composed of an inviscid fluid (e.g. water). The model is derived in a system of local coordinates following a non-erodible bottom and takes into account its curvature. We prove that the model verifies an entropy inequality, preserves water at rest for a sediment layer and their solutions can be seen as particular solutions of incompressible Euler equations under hydrostatic assumptions. Buoyancy effects and the centripetal acceleration of the grain movement due to the curvature of the bottom are considered in the definition of the Coulomb term. We propose a two-step Roe type solver to discretize the presented model. It exactly preserves water at rest and no movement of the sediment layer, when its angle is smaller than the angle of repose, and up to second order all stationary solutions. Finally, some numerical tests are performed by simulating submarine and sub-aerial avalanches as well as the generated tsunami.},

Here we introduce another multilayer system with mass exchanges between the neighborhing layers where the unknowns are a total height of water and an average velocity per layer. We derive it from Navier-Stokes system with an hydrostatic pressure and prove energy and hyperbolicity properties of the model. We also give a kinetic interpretation leading to effective numerical schemes with positivity and energy properties. Numerical tests show the versatility of the approach and its ability to compute recirculation cases with wind forcing.},

   abstract = {Stromboli is an island volcano of the Aeolian Volcanic Arc, characterised by persistent activity. The cone rises about 2500–3000 m from its submarine base with very steep slopes; its summit at 924 m above the sea level. The subaerial growth of Stromboli, occurred in the last 100 ka, has been marked by repeated episodes of large gravitational collapses especially affecting the NW flank of the island in the last 13 ka. The last one occurred less than 5000 years ago forming the deep depression on the NW seaward flank, named Sciara del Fuoco (SdF), and it produced very likely large water waves. This paper envisages a scenario where a huge mass of volcanic material collapses into the sea in the same sector in which the SdF collapse took place in Holocenic times and it computes possible tsunami evolutions assuming the present-day bathymetry. Numerical simulations are performed by means of two distinct models; one for the mass collapse and one for the tsunami. Slope failure dynamics are calculated with the aid of a Lagrangian model: the landslide is subdivided into blocks, and the motion of each constituent block is calculated by applying the basic principle of mechanical momentum conservation, with block–block and block–ambient interactions being taken into account. Water waves are computed by solving a system of shallow-water equations including a forcing term dependent on the sliding mass motion. The finite-element (FE) technique is employed since it permits the use of non-uniform grids, which are adequate to account for marine basins with irregular coastlines. In addition to the sensitivity analysis concerning the main parameters governing the slide motion, two main cases are explored, differing in the slide path followed by the mass. The resulting tsunami is very large, with giant waves as high as several meters (tens of meters in the worst cases) impinging the coast. Due to the strong wave refraction induced by bathymetry, waves travel around the island, affecting even the island coast opposite the source.},

The wave system is decomposed into the incoming waves and the interaction soliton that represents the particularly high wave hump in the crossing area of the waves. Shown is that extreme surface elevations up to four times exceeding the amplitude of the incoming waves typically cover a very small area but in the near-resonance case they may have considerable extension.

   abstract = {The paper presents a method of computing periodic water waves based on solving an integral equation by means of discretization and automatically finding the mesh on which the functions to be found are approximated by the best way. The power of the method to describe ‘bad functions’ well makes it possible to reproduce all the main results of asymptotic theory for the almost-highest waves (Longuet-Higgins & Fox, 1977, 1978, 1996) by a direct numerical simulation. The method is able to compute two full periods of the oscillations of wave properties for all wave height-to-length ratios. The end of the second period corresponds to the wave steepness that achieves 99.99997% of the limiting value. So, the validity of the asymptotic formulae by Longuet-Higgins & Fox is proved for the steep waves of any finite depth. The refined value of the maximum slope of the free-surfaces is found to be 30.3787°.},

In this paper we examine the dispersive properties of MS integrators for the linear wave and sine-Gordon equations. In particular a leapfrog in space and time scheme (a member of the Lobatto Runge–Kutta family of methods) and the Preissman box scheme are considered. We find the numerical dispersion relations are monotonic and that the sign of the group velocity is preserved. The group velocity dispersion (GVD) is found to provide significant information and succinctly explain the qualitative differences in the numerical solutions obtained with the different schemes. Further, the numerical dispersion relations for the linearized sine-Gordon equation provides information on the ability of the MS integrators to capture the sine-Gordon dynamics. We are able to link the numerical dispersion relations to the total energy of the various methods, thus providing information on the coarse grid behavior of MS integrators in the nonlinear regime.},

   abstract = {The characteristics of a tsunami generated by a submarine landslide are mainly determined by the volume, the initial acceleration, the maximum velocity, and the possible retrogressive behaviour of the landslide. The influence of these features as well as water depth and distance from shore are discussed. Submarine landslides are often clearly sub-critical (Froude number 1), and it is explained that the maximum tsunami elevation generally correlates with the product of the landslide volume and acceleration divided by the wave speed squared. Only a limited part of the potential energy released by the landslide is transferred to wave energy. Examples of numerical simulations with fractions of 0.1-15% are presented. Frequency dispersion is of little importance for waves generated by large and sub-critical submarine landslides. Retrogressive landslide behaviour normally reduces associated tsunami heights, but retrogression might increase the height of the landward propagating wave for unfavourable time lags between release of individual elements of the total landslide mass. Tsunamis generated by submarine landslides often have very large run-up heights close to the source area, but have more limited far-field effects than earthquake tsunamis. It is further shown that the combination of landslides and earthquakes may be necessary to explain observed tsunami behaviour. The various aspects mentioned above are exemplified by simulations of the Holocene Storegga Slide, the 1998 Papua New Guinea, and the 2004 Indian Ocean tsunamis. Comparisons are also made to tsunamis generated by rock slides. Rock slides are most often super-critical and the resulting tsunamis are determined by the frontal area of the rock slide, the impact velocity of the rock slide on the water body, the permeability of the rock slide, and the bathymetry.},

Stability theory suggests that the flow remains laminar for all flow rates, but in practice pipe flow becomes turbulent even at moderate speeds. This transition drastically affects the transport efficiency of mass, momentum, and heat. On the basis of the recent discovery of unstable traveling waves in computational studies of the Navier-Stokes equations and ideas from dynamical systems theory, a model for the transition process has been suggested. We report experimental observation of these traveling waves in pipe flow, confirming the proposed transition scenario and suggesting that the dynamics associated with these unstable states may indeed capture the nature of fluid turbulence.},

It is shown that as the disturbance amplitude is increased, nonlinear effects first become significant within the critical layer, which moves away from the pipe wall as a result. It is found that the flow stabilizes once the basic profile has become sufficiently fully developed. By tracing the nonlinear neutral curve back to earlier times, it is found that in addition to the wall mode, which arises from a classical upper branch linear stability analysis, there also exists a nonlinear neutral centre mode, governed primarily by inviscid dynamics. The centre mode problem is solved numerically and the results show the existence of a concentrated region of vorticity centred on or close to the pipe axis and propagating downstream at almost the maximum fluid velocity. The connection between this structure and the puffs and slugs of vorticity observed in experiments is discussed.},

Various vertical coordinate systems used for numerical weather prediction. Mon. Weather Rev. 102, 509 522], the Jacobian pressure gradient formulation of Song [Song, Y.T., 1998.

Weather Rev. 126 (12), 3213 3230], and a newly introduced parametric function that permits both Boussinesq (volume-conserving) and non-Boussinesq (mass-conserving) conditions. Based on this new formulation, a generalized modeling approach is proposed. Several representative oceanographic problems with different scales and characteristics coastal canyon, seamount topography, non-Boussinesq Pacific Ocean with nested eastern Tropics, and a global ocean model have been used to demonstrate the model’s capabilities for multiscale applications. The inclusion of non-Boussinesq physics in the topography-following ocean model does not incur computational expense, but more faithfully represents satellite-observed ocean-bottom-pressure data. Such a generalized modeling approach is expected to benefit oceanographers in solving multiscale ocean-related problems by using various coordinate systems on the same numerical platform.},

   abstract = {We present a study on the nonlinear dynamics of small long-wave disturbances to the laminar state in non-rotating axisymmetric Poiseuille pipe flows. At high Reynolds numbers, the associated Navier-Stokes equations can be reduced to a set of coupled Korteweg-de Vries-type (KdV) equations that support inviscid and smooth travelling waves numerically computed using the Petviashvili method. In physical space they correspond to localized toroidal vortices concentrated near the pipe boundaries (wall vortexons) or that wrap around the pipe axis (centre vortexons), in agreement with the analytical soliton solutions derived by Fedele (2012). The KdV dynamics of a perturbation is also investigated by means of an high accurate Fourier-based numerical scheme. We observe that an initial vortical patch splits into a centre vortexon radiating patches of vorticity near the wall. These can undergo further splitting leading to a proliferation of centre vortexons that eventually decay due to viscous effects. The splitting process originates from a radial flux of azimuthal vorticity from the wall to the pipe axis in agreement with the inverse cascade of cross-stream vorticity identified in channel flows by Eyink (2008). The inviscid vortexon most likely is unstable to non-axisymmetric disturbances and may be a precursor to puffs and slug flow formation.},

   abstract = {Pressurized water reactor (PWR) or liquid-metal fast breeder reactor cores or fuel assemblies, PWR steam generators, condensers, and tubular heat exchangers are basic components of a nuclear power plant that involve two-phase flows in tube or rod bundles. A deep knowledge of the detailed flow patterns on the shell side is necessary to evaluate departure from nucleate boiling (DNB) margins in reactor cores, singularity effects (grids, wire spacers, support plates, and baffles), corrosion on the steam generator tube sheet, bypass effects, and vibration risks. For that purpose, Electricit� de France has developed since 1986 a general purpose Thermal-HYdraulic Code (THYC) to study three-dimensional single- and two-phase flows in rod or tube bundles (PWR cores, steam generators, condensers, and heat exchangers). It considers the three-dimensional domain to contain two kinds of components : fluid and solids. The THYC model is obtained by space-time averaging of the instantaneous equations (mass, momentum, and energy) of each phase over control volumes including fluid and solids. The physical model of THYC is validated under several French and international experiments for single- and two-phase flows. The THYC is used for the calculation of transients such as steam-line break (coupled with a three-dimensional neutronics code), for DNB predictions, and for various steam generator or condenser studies.},

This prominent paper turned a new leaf in coastal hydrodynamics along with contributions by Serre (La Houille Blanche 8:374-388, 1953, [72]) and Green and Naghdi (J Fluid Mech 78:237-246, 1976, [47]) and many others since then. Several modern Boussinesq-type systems stem from these pioneering works. In the present work, we revise the long wave model traditionally referred to as the Peregrine system. Namely, we propose a modification of the governing equations, which is asymptotically similar to the initial model for weakly nonlinear waves, while preserving an additional symmetry of the complete water wave problem. This modification procedure is called the invariantization. We show that the improved system has well-conditioned dispersive terms in the swash zone, hence allowing for efficient and stable run-up computations.},

It is found, to the lowest order of perturbation, that the complicated system of equations governing such modulation can be reduced to a simple nonlinear Schrodinger equation. A nonlinear plane wave solution to this equation is found to correspond to the so-called Stokes wave. The linear stability of this plane wave solution is essentially determined by the sign of the product of two coefficients in this equation, yielding Benjamin and Whitham's criterion. The same equation is found to give a weak cnoidal wave derived from the Korteweg-de Vries equation in the shallow-water limit.},

Graded beds were formed; the mechanism of deposition was studied by motion photography and the size grading by 150 size analyses.Deposition of sediment took place behind the head even at a time when there was no deceleration of the head: the greater part of the thickness of the bed was deposited during a period of rapid decline in velocity of flow within the body of the current. The mechanism of deposition and the type of grading differed for beds deposited from suspensions with concentrations less than and greater than about 30% by volume. Low concentration suspensions formed 'distribution grading' in which all percentiles showed vertical grading and at least the coarser half of the distribution showed lateral size decrease away from the gate. High concentration suspensions formed 'coarse-tail grading' in which there was almost no lateral size variation and the vertical grading was shown only by the coarsest few percentiles (except at the top of the bed).In high concentration flows the bed did not accumulate layer by layer, as it did in low concentration flows, but was deposited first as an expanded 'quick' layer, which was deformed by shearing and waves produced by the entrained water flowing over the still plastic bed.In both types of graded beds the sorting coefficient (standard deviation of the logarithm of the settling velocity) decreased upward within the bed, and to a lesser extent also laterally away from the gate. The skewness reached a maximum near the center of the bed and became negative at the top.},

This problem is addressed herein: a detailed analysis indicates that the Bagnold criterion is necessary but insufficient for self-sustaining turbidity currents. The analysis reveals two possible equilibrium states, a relatively low-velocity ignitive state, and a high-velocity, dense catastrophic state. A stability analysis indicates that the ignitive state is unstable; flows below it invariably die out, and flows above it “ignite”, i.e. accelerate and entrain sediment to the catastrophic state, which is stable. The ignitive state thus defines the criterion for a self-sustaining turbidity current. Estimates of the catastrophic state suggest that it is highly erosive and competent to scour out submarine canyons.},

All such solutions may be written in terms of an amplitude and a phase. Solutions with piecewise constant phase have been well studied previously. Some of these solutions were found to be stable with respect to one-dimensional perturbations. No such solutions are stable with respect to two-dimensional perturbations. We consider stability of the larger class of solutions whose phase is dependent on the spatial dimension of the one-dimensional wave form. We study the spectral stability of such nontrivial-phase solutions numerically, using Hill's method. We present evidence which suggests that all such nontrivial-phase solutions are unstable with respect to both one- and two-dimensional perturbations. Instability occurs in all cases: for both the elliptic and hyperbolic nonlinear Schrödinger equations, and in the focusing and defocusing cases.},

   abstract = {A novel tool for tsunami wave modeling is presented. This tool has the potential of being used for operational purposes: indeed, the numerical code VOLNA is able to handle the complete life cycle of a tsunami (generation, propagation and run-up along the coast). The algorithm works on unstructured triangular meshes and thus can be run in arbitrary complex domains. This paper contains a detailed description of the finite volume scheme implemented in the code. The numerical treatment of the wet/dry transition is explained. This point is crucial for accurate run-up/run-down computations. The majority of tsunami codes use semi-empirical techniques at this stage, which are not always sufficient for tsunami hazard mitigation. Indeed the decision to evacuate inhabitants is based on inundation maps, which are produced with these types of numerical tools. We present several realistic test cases that partially validate our algorithm. Comparisons with analytical solutions and experimental data are performed. Finally, the main conclusions are outlined and the perspectives for future research presented.},

The main purpose of this study is to check the pertinence of the NSWE for flooding processes. From the mathematical point of view, the answer is not obvious since all derivation procedures assumes the total water depth positivity. We performed a comparison between the two-fluid Navier-Stokes simulations and the NSWE solved analytically and numerically.

   abstract = {Nearly 40 years have passed since V. I. Talanov discovered the nonlinear parabolic equation which played an important role in the nonlinear optics. It was very quickly understood that this equation could also be adapted for nonstationary wave packets of different physical nature and of any dimension. Under the later name of the nonlinear (cubic) Schrödinger equation, it became a fundamental equation in the theory of weakly nonlinear wave packets in media with strong dispersion. The article is devoted to only one application of the nonlinear Schrödinger equation in the theory of the so-called freak waves on the sea surface. In the last five years a great boom has occurred in the research of extreme waves on the water, for which the nonlinear parabolic equation played an important role in the understanding of physical mechanisms of the freak-wave phenomenon. More accurate, preferably numerical, models of waves on a water with more comprehensive account of the nonlinearity and dispersion come on the spot today, and many results of weakly nonlinear models are already corrected quantitatively. Nevertheless, sophisticated models do not bring new physical concepts. Hence, their description on the basis of the nonlinear parabolic equation (nonlinear Schrödinger equation), performed in this paper, seems very attractive in view of their possible applications in the wave-motion physics.},

The investigated discretization reduces to the Preissman box scheme when used on a rectangular grid. Concerning arbitrary quadrilateral grids, we show that only methods with parallelogram-like finite volume cells lead to a multi-symplectic discretization; i.e., to a method that preserves a discrete conservation law of symplecticity. One of the advantages of finite volume methods is that they can be easily adjusted to variable meshes. But, although the implementation of moving mesh finite volume methods for multi-symplectic PDEs is rather straightforward, the restriction to parallelogram-like cells implies that only meshes moving with a constant speed are multi-symplectic. To overcome this restriction, we suggest the implementation of reversible moving mesh methods based on a semi-Lagrangian approach. Numerical experiments are presented for a one dimensional dispersive shallow-water system.},

Lett. 69, 609 (1992) and a terrain-following Boussinesq system recently deduced by Nachbin SIAM J Appl. Math. 63, 905 (2003). The regime considers finite-amplitude surface gravity waves on a two-dimensional incompressible and inviscid fluid of, highly variable, finite depth. A Fourier-type operator is expanded in a wave steepness parameter. The novelty is that the topography can vary on a broad range of scales. It can also have a complex profile including that of a multiply valued function. The resulting evolution equations are variable coefficient Boussinesq-type equations. The formulation is over a periodically extended domain so that, as an application, it produces efficient Fourier (fast-Fourier-transform algorithm) solvers.},

   abstract = {Turbulent flow is a most important branch of fluid dynamics yet its complexity has tended to make it one of the least understood. Empirical data have been appearing rapidly for more than twenty years but a consistent theory of turbulent flow based on the results has been lacking. The original edition of Dr Townsend's book was the first to attempt a systematic and comprehensive discussion of all kinds of turbulent motion and to provide a reliable analysis of the processes which occur. The theory and associated concepts are applied to the description of a variety of flows: free turbulent flows such as wakes and jets, wall flows in pipes and boundary layers, flows affected by buoyancy forces such as heat plumes and the atmospheric boundary layer and flows with curved streamlines. This monograph will appeal to practitioners and researchers in engineering, meteorology, oceanography, physics and applied mathematics. This paperback edition was first issued in hard covers in 1976 as a complete revision, taking into account developments since 1955, of the first edition. It will be useful as an advanced text in applied mathematics, and the other disciplines mentioned above.},

Most of the analytical and numerical studies are limited to a constant slope plain shore and to the classical nonlinear shallow water equations. However, in nature the shore is characterized by some roughness. In order to take into account the effects of the bottom rugosity, various ad hoc friction terms are usually used. In this Letter, we study the effect of the roughness of the bottom on the maximum run-up height. A stochastic model is proposed to describe the bottom irregularity, and its effect is quantified by using Monte Carlo simulations. For the discretization of the nonlinear shallow water equations, we employ modern finite volume schemes. Moreover, the results of the random bottom model are compared with the more conventional approaches.},

The validation is performed in the case of water hammer in a rigid pipe: we compare the numerical results provided by an industrial code with those of our spatial second-order implicit scheme.

Hyperpycnal plumes can travel significant distances beyond the continental shelf and may be sustained for hours to weeks. There are several Apennine Rivers in Italy that are likely to develop hyperpycnal discharges on the Western Adriatic shelf. Among them, River Tronto is a moderately ‘dirty’ river capable of producing 64 hyperpycnal flow events (lasting ⩾ 6 h) during a 100 year period. Numerical simulations of hyperpycnal events have been conducted for the Adriatic shelf near the mouth of River Tronto using a two-dimensional depth-integrated finite volume model to study the spreading of the plume and its interaction with the alongshore current. Simulation results indicate that the alongshore current has great impact on the spreading and deposition pattern of the hyperpycnal flow. Sedimentary deposits generated from a series of simulated hyperpycnal flow events have developed undulating bed forms.},

   abstract = {The 26 December 2004 Great Sumatra–Andaman earthquake opened a new era for seismologists to understand the complex source process of a great earthquake. This is the first event with moment magnitude greater than 9 since the deployment of high-dynamic-range broadband seismic and Global Positioning System (GPS) sensors around the globe. This study presents an analysis of the ruptured fault- plane geometry and slip distribution using long-period teleseismic data and GPS- measured static surface displacements near the fault plane. We employ a rupture geometry with six along-strike segments with and without a steeper down-dip extension. The fault segments are further subdivided into a total of 201 ∼ 30 × 30 km fault patches. Sensitivity tests of fault-plane geometry and the variation in rupture velocity indicate that the dip and curvature of the fault plane are not well resolved from the given data set and the rupture velocity is constrained to be between 1.8 and 2.6 km/sec. Error estimations of the slip distribution using a random selection of seismic and GPS station subsets (50% of all stations) illustrate that slip is well resolved along the whole rupture and the mean slip uncertainty is less than 1.5 m (about 11%). Although it is possible that near-field GPS data include contributions from additional postseismic transient deformation, our preferred model suggests that the Sumatra–Andaman earthquake had a magnitude of Mw 9.20 + 0.05/−0.06.},

   abstract = {The CumbreViejavolcano is the youngest component of the island of La Palma. It is a very steep-sided oceanic island volcano, of a type which may undergo large-scale lateral collapse with little precursory deformation. Reconfiguration of the volcanic rift zones and underlying dyke swarms of the volcano is used to determine the present degree of instability of the volcano. For most of its history, from before 125 ka ago to around 20 ka, the CumbreViejavolcano was characterised by a triple (“Mercedes Star”) volcanic rift zone geometry. The three rift zones were unequally developed, with a highly productive south rift zone and weaker NE and NW rift zones: the disparity in activity was probably due to topographic-gravitational stresses associated with the west facing Cumbre Nueva collapse structure underneath the western flank of the CumbreVieja. From 20 ka to about 7 ka, activity on the NW volcanic rift zone diminished and the intersection of the rift zones migrated slightly to the north. More recently, the triple rift geometry has been replaced at the surface by a N–S-trending rift zone which transects the volcano, and by E–W-trending en echelon fissure arrays on the western flank of the volcano. The NE rift zone has become completely inactive. This structural reconfiguration indicates weakening of the western flank of the volcano. The most recent eruption near the summit of the CumbreVieja, that of 1949, was accompanied by development of a west facing normal fault system along the crest of the volcano. The geometry of this fault system and the timing of its formation in relation to episodes of vent opening during the eruption indicate that it is not the surface expression of a dyke. Instead, it is interpreted as being the first surface rupture along a developing zone of deformation and seaward movement within the western flank of the CumbreVieja: the volcano is therefore considered to be at an incipient stage of flank instability. Climatic factors or strain weakening along the Cumbre Nueva collapse structure may account for the recent development of this instability.},

The mean dissipation rate per unit mass averaged over the epilimnion varies between O(10-10) m2 s-3 in calm weather to O(10-8) m2 s-3 in winds of 8 m s-1, for surface buoyancy fluxes of 6 X 10-9 m2 s-3 and 1.1 X 10-8 m2 s-3, whereas near the slope has an average value of 3 X 10-8 m2 s-3. The relation between Kz and N-2 (where N is the buoyancy frequency) is examined. Values of the mixing efficiency, = N-2Kz-1, of 0.15 0.1 and 0.16 0.1 21 z are obtained in the upper 10-m layer for calm and windy conditions, respectively. Near the slope, is found to be 0.22 0.2, slightly larger than in surface layers under windy conditions. Different mixing mechanisms in different regions, near the slope and in the surface waters of the epilimnion and relatively calm deeper layers, can be identified in the diagram of overturn Froude number versus overturn Reynolds number. Mixing near the slope in the epilimnion appears to be related to the gravitational winter cascading of cold water down the sloping sides of the lake.},

A large number (N = O(1000)) of free wave modes are typically used whose amplitude evolutions are determined through a pseudospectral treatment of the nonlinear free-surface conditions. The computational effort is directly proportional to N and M, and the convergence with N and M is exponentially fast for waves up to approximately 80% of Stokes limiting steepness (ka [similar] 0.35). The efficiency and accuracy of the method is demonstrated by comparisons to fully nonlinear semi-Lagrangian computations (Vinje & Brevig 1981); calculations of long-time evolution of wavetrains using the modified (fourth-order) Zakharov equations (Stiassnie & Shemer 1987); and experimental measurements of a travelling wave packet (Su 1982). As a final example of the usefulness of the method, we consider the nonlinear interactions between two colliding wave envelopes of different carrier frequencies.},

Usually, only the vertical bottom motion is taken into account while the horizontal co-seismic displacements are neglected in the absence of landslides. In the present study we propose a methodology based on the well-known Okada solution to reconstruct in more details all components of the bottom coseismic displacements. Then, the sea-bed motion is coupled with a three-dimensional weakly nonlinear water wave solver which allows us to simulate a tsunami wave generation. We pay special attention to the evolution of kinetic and potential energies of the resulting wave while the contribution of the horizontal displacements into wave energy balance is also quantified. Such contribution of horizontal displacements to the tsunami generation has not been discussed before, and it is different from the existing approaches. The methods proposed in this study are illustrated on the July 17, 2006 Java tsunami and some more recent events.},

In the 2 +1-dimensional case, the dispersive grouping is accompanied with a geometrical focusing. Necessary wave conditions for the occurrence of such a phenomenon are discussed. Influence of non-optimal phase modulation and presence of strong random wave component are found to be weak: they do not cancel the mechanism of wave amplification. The mechanism of dispersive focusing is compared with the wave enhancement due to the BenjaminFeir instability, which is found to be extremely sensitive with respect to weak random perturbations.},

   abstract = {In order to gain insight into how to invert seismograms correctly to estimate the details of the earthquake rupturing process, we perform numerical experiments using artificial data, generated for an idealized faulting model with a very simple rupture and moment release history, and solve the inverse problem using standard widely used inversion methods. We construct synthetic accelerograms in the vicinity of an earthquake for a discrete analog of the Haskell-type rupture model with a prescribed rupture velocity in a layered medium. A constant level of moment is released as the rupture front passes by. We show that using physically based constraints, such as not permitting back slip on the fault, allow us to reproduce many aspects of the solution correctly, whereas the minimum norm solution or the solution with the smallest first differences of moment rates in space and time do not reproduce many aspects for the cases studied here. With the positivity of moment rate constraint, as long as the rupturing area is allowed to be larger than that in the forward problem, it is correctly found for the simple faulting model considered in this paper, provided that the rupture velocity and the Earth structure are known. If, however, the rupture front is constrained either to propagate more slowly or the rupturing area is taken smaller than that in the forward problem, we find that we are unable even to fit the accelerograms well. Use of incorrect crustal structure in the source region also leads to poor fitting of the data. In this case, the proper rupture front is not obtained, but instead a “ghost front” is found behind the correct rupture front and demonstrates how the incorrect crustal structure is transformed into an artifact in the solution. The positions of the centroids of the moment release in time and space are generally correctly obtained.},

Similar to their sub-aerial counterparts, submarine mass movements can consist of soil or rock and can take the form of slides, spreads, flows, topples or falls, but in addition they can develop into turbidity currents.

A well-balanced discretization is used for the treatment of source terms. The method is well balanced, nonoscillatory, and suitable for both structured and unstructured triangular meshes. An adaptive procedure is also considered for the two-dimensional problems to update the bed-load accounting for the interaction between the bed-load and the water flow. The proposed method is applied to several sediment transport problems in one and two space dimensions. The numerical results demonstrate high resolution of the proposed finite volume method and confirm its capability to provide accurate simulations for sediment transport problems under flow regimes with strong shocks.},

Even for the well-studied case of pipe flow, it has not been possible to determine at what Reynolds number the motion will be either persistently turbulent or ultimately laminar. We show that in pipes, turbulence that is transient at low Reynolds numbers becomes sustained at a distinct critical point. Through extensive experiments and computer simulations, we were able to identify and characterize the processes ultimately responsible for sustaining turbulence. In contrast to the classical Landau-Ruelle-Takens view that turbulence arises from an increase in the temporal complexity of fluid motion, here, spatial proliferation of chaotic domains is the decisive process and intrinsic to the nature of fluid turbulence.},

To perform stable inversion, we applied smoothing constraints to the slip distribution with respect to time and space, and determined the optimal weights of constraints using an optimized Akaike's Bayesian Information Criterion (ABIC). We found that the rupture propagates mainly along the dip direction, and the length of the rupture area is shorter than its width. The mean rise time in the shallow asperity is significantly longer than that in the deep asperity, which might be attributed to variable frictional properties or lower strength of the plate interface at shallower depths. The average rupture velocity of deep asperity extends to the shear-wave velocity. The derived source parameters are as follows: seismic moment Mo = 1.7 1021 Nm (Mw 8.0); source duration = 50 sec. We also estimated the shear stress change due to the mainshock on and around the major fault zone. It appears that many aftershocks on the plate boundary took place in and adjacent to the zones of stress increase due to the rupture of the mainshock.},

The discrete spectrum of the associated scattering problem is found, which is used to describe the asymptotic solution of the initial-value problem. It is found that while initial disturbances of the same sign as the quadratic nonlinear coefficient result in generation of only solitons, the case of the opposite polarity of the initial disturbance has a variety of possible outcomes. In this case solitons of different polarities as well as breathers may occur. The bifurcation point when two eigenvalues corresponding to solitons merge to the eigenvalues associated with breathers is considered in more detail. Direct numerical simulations show that breathers and soliton pairs of different polarities can appear from a simple box-like initial disturbance.},

Small and moderate amplitude elevation solitary waves, which were known to be linearly unstable, are shown to evolve into stable depression solitary waves, together with a radiated wave field. Depression waves and certain large amplitude elevation waves were found to be robust to numerical perturbations. Two kinds of collisions are computed: head-on collisions whereby the waves are almost unchanged, and overtaking collisions which are either almost elastic if the wave amplitudes are both large or destroy the smaller wave in the case of a small amplitude wave overtaking a large one.},

@article{Dietrich1982,
   abstract = {Data from 14 previous experimental studies were used to develop an empirical equation that accounts for the effects of size, density, shape, and roundness on the settling velocity of natural sediment. This analysis was done in terms of four nondimensional parameters, namely, the dimensionless nominal diameter D *, the dimensionless settling velocity W *, the Corey shape factor, and the Powers roundness index. For high D * (large or dense particles), changes in roundness and shape factor have similar magnitude effects on settling velocity. Roundness varies much less for naturally occuring grains, however, and hence is a less important control than shape. For a typical coarse sand with a Powers roundness of 3.5 and a Corey shape factor of 0.7, the settling velocity is about 0.68 that of a sphere of the same D *, with shape and roundness effects contributing about equally to the settling velocity reduction. At low D * the reduction in settling velocity due to either shape or roundness is much less. Moreover, at low D *, low roundness causes a greater decrease in settling velocity at low shape factor values than at high shape factor values. This appears to be due to the increased surface drag on the flatter grains.},

   abstract = {The present paper describes a new mathematical model of turbidity flow, this model having been constructed so as to investigate the interaction between the velocity and effective density of the flow. The differential equations involved represent a version of the so-called “slab model” and involve many simplifying assumptions; however, these equations are non-linear, and have therefore been investigated by phase-plane analysis, a very useful technique which provides graphical and numerical solutions of suitable equations to any desired degree of accuracy. Following a summary of earlier models of turbidity flow, Bagnold's (1963) criterion for autosuspension is discussed, and a revised version proposed. The new model is then developed, initially in a simplified form, in order to illustrate the mathematical properties of the equations, the (four) possible types of turbidity flow, and their relationship to the revised criterion for autosuspension. A physical version of the model, with plausible values for the controlling parameters, is then described. The model as a whole provides a satisfactory qualitative explanation of the essential difference between relatively weak, secular turbidity flow, and the episodes of strong turbidity flow which are evidently responsible for the deposition of turbidites. Flows of the latter variety can be explained as phases of autosuspension. The physical version of the model indicates that the current velocities, effective densities, and bottom gradients necessary for autosuspension are not wildly improbable, either on the shelf or the slope, and autosuspension may indeed occur in appropriate places.},

However, the characteristic wavelength of the free surface motion is generally smaller than in geophysically generated tsunamis. Thus, dispersive effects need to be taken into account. In the present study the fluid layer is modeled by the Peregrine system modified appropriately and written in conservative variables. The landslide is assumed to be a quasi-deformable body of mass whose trajectory is completely determined by its barycenter motion. A differential equation modeling the landslide motion along a curvilinear bottom is obtained by projecting all the forces acting on the submerged body onto a local moving coordinate system. One of the main novelties of our approach consists in taking into account curvature effects of the sea bed.},

The method is based on a ‘relaxed’ variational principle, i.e., on a Lagrangian involving as many variables as possible. This formulation is particularly suitable for the construction of approximate water wave models, since it allows more freedom while preserving a variational structure. The advantages of this relaxed formulation are illustrated with various examples in shallow and deep waters, as well as arbitrary depths. Using subordinate constraints (e.g., irrotationality or free surface impermeability) in various combinations, several model equations are derived, some being well-known, other being new. The models obtained are studied analytically and exact traveling wave solutions are constructed when possible.},

Numerical tools fail to reproduce tsunami nearshore and onshore processes well, and physical experiments in large scale hydraulic facilities worldwide have been limited to the generation of solitary waves as an (controversial) approximation for evolved forms of tsunami. The new concept in wave generation presented herein is born of collaboration between UCL's Earthquake and People Interaction Centre (EPICentre) and HR Wallingford. It allows for the first time the stable simulation of extremely long waves led either by a crest or a trough (depressed wave). This paper presents the working concepts behind the newwavegenerator and the first stages of testing for verifying its capacities and limitations. It is shown that the newwavegenerator can not only reproduce solitary waves and N-waves with large wavelengths, but also the 2004 Indian Ocean Tsunami as recorded off the coast of Thailand (“Mercator” trace).},

   abstract = {We investigated the source mechanism of the 1975 Kalapana, Hawaii, earthquake (MS = 7.2) by modeling the tsunamis observed at three tide-gauge stations, Hilo, Kahului, and Honolulu. We computed synthetic tsunamis for various fault models. The arrival times and the amplitudes of the synthetic tsunamis computed for Ando's fault model (fault length = 40 km, fault width = 20 km, strike = N70°E, dip = 20°SE, rake = −90°, fault depth = 10 km, and slip = 5.6 m) are ∼10 min earlier and 5 times smaller than those of the observed, respectively. We tested fault models with different dip angles and depths. Models with a northwest dip direction yield larger tsunami amplitudes than those with a southeast dip direction. Models with shallower fault depths produce later first arrivals than deeper models. We also considered the effects of the Hilina fault system, but its contribution to tsunami excitation is insignificant. This suggests that another mechanism is required to explain the tsunamis. One plausible model is a propagating slump model with a 1 m subsidence along the coast and a l m uplift offshore. This model can explain the arrival times and the amplitudes of the observed tsunamis satisfactorily. An alternative model is a wider fault model that dips 10°NW, with its fault plane extending 25 km offshore, well beyond the aftershock area of the Kalapana earthquake. These two models produce a similar uplift pattern offshore and, kinematically, are indistinguishable as far as tsunami excitation is concerned. The total volume of displaced water is estimated to be ∼2.5 km3. From the comparison of slump model and the single-force model suggested earlier from seismological data we prefer a combination of faulting and large-scale slumping on the south flank of Kilauea volcano as the most appropriate model for the 1975 Kalapana earthquake. Two basic mechanisms have been presented for explaining the deformation of the south flank of Kilauea: (1) pressure and density variation along the rift zone caused by magma injection and (2) gravitational instability due to the steep topography of the south flank of Kilauea. In either mechanism, large displacements on the south flank are involved that are responsible for the observed large tsunamis.},

   abstract = {The evolution of nonlinear Kelvin waves is studied using analytical and numerical methods. In the absence of dispersive (nonhydrostatic) effects, such waves may evolve to braking. The authors find that one of the effects of rotation is to delay the onset of breaking in time by up to 60%, with respect to a comparable wave in de absence of rotation. This delay is consistent with qualitative conclusions based on transverse averaging of the evolution equations. Further, the onset of breaking occurs almost simultaneously over a zone of uniform phase that is normal to the boundary and extends over a distance comparable to the Rossby radius of deformation. In other words, the process of breaking embraces the most energetic area of the wave. In contrast to the linear Kelvin wave, the nonlinear wave develops a dipole structure in the cross-shelf velocity, with a zero net offshore flow. With increasing nonlinearity the flow develops a stronger offshore jet ahead of the wave crest. The Kelvin wave amplitude at the coast delays slightly with time. This and other major features of the wave are accounted for by an analytical model based on slowly varying averaged variables. As part of the analysis it is demonstrated that the evolution of the wave phase may be described by an inhomogeneous Klein-Gordon equation.},

An asymptotic analysis valid for water depths going to zero clearly shows that the use of such a term implies a non-receding motion of the shoreline. This phenomenon is induced by a thin layer of water which, because of frictional forces, remains on the beach and keeps it wet seaward of the largest run-up. However, the influence of such a frictional layer of water on the global wave motion is very weak and practically negligible for most of the swash zone flow dynamics. The existence of a non-receding shoreline has led to some clarifications on the role of some ad-hoc tools used in numerical models for the prediction of the wet/dry interface.},

   abstract = {In this essay we give an overview on the problem of rogue or freak wave formation in the ocean. The matter of the phenomenon is a sporadic occurrence of unexpectedly high waves on the sea surface. These waves cause serious danger for sailing and sea use. A number of huge wave accidents, resulting in damages, ship losses and people injuries and deaths, are known. Now marine researchers do believe that these waves belong to a specific kind of sea wave, not taken into account by conventional models for sea wind waves. This paper addresses the nature of the rogue wave problem from a general viewpoint based on wave process ideas. We start by introducing some primitive elements of sea wave physics with the purpose of paving the way for further discussion. We discuss linear physical mechanisms which are responsible for high wave formation, at first. Then, we proceed with a description of different sea conditions, starting from the open deep sea, and approaching the sea coast. Nonlinear effects which are able to cause rogue waves are emphasised. In conclusion we briefly discuss the generality of the physical mechanisms suggested for the rogue wave explanation; they are valid for rogue wave phenomena in other media such as solid matters, superconductors, plasmas and nonlinear optics.},

First of all, we propose a simple and computationally inexpensive model for the description of the sea bed displacement during an underwater earthquake, based on the finite fault solution for the slip distribution under some assumptions on the dynamics of the rupturing process. Once the bottom motion is reconstructed, we study waves induced on the free surface of the ocean. For this purpose, we consider three different models approximating the Euler equations of the water wave theory. Namely, we use the linearized Euler equations (we are in fact solving the Cauchy-Poisson problem), a Boussinesq system, and a novel weakly nonlinear model. An intercomparison of these approaches is performed. The developments of the present study are illustrated on the July 17, 2006 Java event, where an underwater earthquake of magnitude 7.7 generated a tsunami that inundated the southern coast of Java.},

The deformation included two major northeast-trending zones of uplift and subsidence situated between the Aleutian Trench and the Aleutian Volcanic Arc; together they are 700 to 800 kilometers long and from 150 to 250 kilometers wide. The seaward zone is one in which uplift of as much as 10 meters on land and 15 meters on the sea floor has occurred as a result of both crustal warping and local faulting. Submarine uplift within this zone generated a train of seismic sea waves with half-wave amplitudes of more than 7 meters along the coast near the source. The adjacent zone to the northwest is one of subsidence that averages about 1 meter and attains a measured maximum of 2.3 meters. A second zone of slight uplift may exist along all or part of the Aleutian and Alaska ranges northwest of the zone of subsidence.},

Previous numerical computations have succeeded only in integrating the equations of motion up to the instant when the surface becomes vertical. In this paper we present a new method for following the time-history of space-periodic irrotational surface waves. The only independent variables are the coordinates and velocity potential of marked particles at the free surface. At each time-step an integral equation is solved for the new normal component of velocity. The method is faster and more accurate than previous methods based on a two dimensional grid. It has also the advantage that the marked particles become concentrated near regions of sharp curvature. Viscosity and surface tension are both neglected. The method is tested on a free, steady wave of finite amplitude, and is found to give excellent agreement with independent calculations based on Stokes's series. It is then applied to unsteady waves, produced by initially applying an asymmetric distribution of pressure to a symmetric, progressive wave. The freely running wave then steepens and overturns. It is demonstrated that the surface remains rounded till well after the over-turning takes place.},

   abstract = {In order to monitor the Stromboli submarine slope after the 30 December 2002 landslide and tsunami, repeated marine surveys were carried out offshore of Sciara del Fuoco. The morphological changes and depositionalprocesses that brought to the gradual filling of the slide scar have been studied in detail. Thirteen surveys in a period of little more than 4 years provided a unique opportunity to reconstruct the morpho-sedimentary evolution of the submarine slope and its recovery after the mass-wasting event. The scar has been progressively filled with lava and volcanoclastic debris; in the first month and a half, the filling rate was very high due to the entrance of lava flows into the sea and to the morphological readjustment of the slope; in the following months/years the rate dramatically decreased when the eruptive vents moved upwards and the eruption finally stopped. After 4 years (February 2007) more than 40% of the scar was already filled. In early 2007, a new eruption occurred and a lava delta was constructed in the 2002 scar, influencing the natural readjustment of the slope; therefore, our reconstruction only encompasses the period between the 2002 and 2007 eruptions. The swath bathymetry reconstruction of geometry and volume of scar filling during the period 2002–2007 evidenced a punctuated and fast shift of depocenters and debris emplacement through avalanching processes. This process quickly obliterated the features produced by the 2002 tsunamigenic landslide so that a major question about the preservation potential of mass-wasting features on active volcanic flanks emerges.},

   abstract = {This thesis concerns the mathematical and numerical study of nonlinear hyperbolic partial differential equations. A first part deals with an emergent problematic: the coupling of hyperbolic equations. The pursued applications are linked with the mathematical coupling of computing platforms, dedicated to an adaptative simulation of multi-scale phenomena. We propose and analyze a new coupling formalism based on extended PDE systems avoiding the geometric treatment of the interfaces. In addition, it allows to formulate the problem in a multidimensional setting, with possible covering of the coupled models. This formalism allows in particular to equip the coupling procedure with viscous regularization mechanisms, useful in the selection of natural discontinuous solutions. We analyze existence and uniqueness in the framework of a parabolic regularization à la Dafermos. Existence of a solution holds true under very general conditions but failure of uniqueness may naturally arise as soon as resonance occurs at the interfaces. Next, we highlight that our extended PDE framework gives rise to another regularization strategy based on thick interfaces. In this setting, we prove existence and uniqueness of the solutions of the Cauchy problem for initial data in $L^\infty$. The main tool consists in the derivation of a flexible and robust finite volume method for general triangulation which is analyzed in the setting of entropy measure-valued solutions by DiPerna. The second part is devoted to the definition of a finite volume scheme for the computing of nonclassical solutions of a scalar conservation law based on a kinetic relation. This scheme offers the feature to be stricto sensu conservative, in opposition to a Glimm approach that is only statistically conservative. The validity of our approach is illustrated through numerical examples.},

   abstract = {The Papua New Guinea (PNG) tsunami of July 1998 was a seminal event because it demonstrated that relatively small and relatively deepwater Submarine Mass Failures (SMFs) can cause devastating local tsunamis that strike without warning. There is a comprehensive data set that proves this event was caused by a submarine slump. Yet, the source of the tsunami has remained controversial. This controversy is attributed to several causes. Before the PNG event, it was questionable as to whether SMFs could cause devastating tsunamis. As a result, only limited modelling of SMFs as tsunami sources had been undertaken, and these excluded slumps. The results of these models were that SMFs in general were not considered to be a potential source of catastrophic tsunamis. To effectively model a SMF requires fairly detailed geological data, and these too had been lacking. In addition, qualitative data, such as evidence from survivors, tended to be disregarded in assessing alternative tsunami sources. The use of marine geological data to identify areas of recent submarine failure was not widely applied. The disastrous loss of life caused by the PNG tsunami resulted in a major investigation into the area offshore of the devastated coastline, with five marine expeditions taking place. This was the first time that a focussed, large-scale, international programme of marine surveying had taken place so soon after a major tsunami. It was also the first time that such a comprehensive data set became the basis for tsunami simulations. The use of marine mapping subsequently led to a larger involvement of marine geologists in the study of tsunamis, expanding the knowledge base of those studying the threat from SMF hazards. This paper provides an overview of the PNG tsunami and its impact on tsunami science. It presents revised interpretations of the slump architecture based on new seabed relief images and, using these, the most comprehensive tsunami simulation of the PNG event to date. Simulation results explain the measured runups to a high degree. The PNG tsunami has made a major impact on tsunami science. It is one of the most studied SMF tsunamis, yet it remains the only one known of its type: a slump.},

   abstract = {Case studies of landslide tsunamis require integration of marine geology data and interpretations into numerical simulations of tsunami attack. Many landslide tsunami generation and propagation models have been proposed in recent time, further motivated by the 1998 Papua New Guinea event. However, few of these models have proven capable of integrating the best available marine geology data and interpretations into successful case studies that reproduce all available tsunami observations and records. We show that nonlinear and dispersive tsunami propagation models may be necessary for many landslide tsunami case studies. GEOWAVE is a comprehensive tsunami simulation model formed in part by combining the Tsunami Open and Progressive Initial Conditions System (TOPICS) with the fully nonlinear Boussinesq water wave model FUNWAVE. TOPICS uses curve fits of numerical results from a fully nonlinear potential flow model to provide approximate landslide tsunami sources for tsunami propagation models, based on marine geology data and interpretations. In this work, we validate GEOWAVE with successful case studies of the 1946 Unimak, Alaska, the 1994 Skagway, Alaska, and the 1998 Papua New Guinea events. GEOWAVE simulates accurate runup and inundation at the same time, with no additional user interference or effort, using a slot technique. Wave breaking, if it occurs during shoaling or runup, is also accounted for with a dissipative breaking model acting on the wave front.

   abstract = {Two-dimensional potential flows due to progressive surface waves in deep water are considered. For periodic waves, only gravity is included in the dynamic boundary condition, but both gravity and surface tension are taken into account for solitary waves. The validity of the steady first-order cnoidal wave approximation, i.e. the periodic solution of KdV, is extended to infinite depth by renormalizations. This renormalized cnoidal wave (RCW) solution is expressed as a Fourier–Padé approximation. It is analytically simpler and more accurate than fifth-order Stokes approximations. It is also capable of describing the recently discovered sharp-crested wave. A sharp-crested wave is obtained when the fluid velocity at the crest is larger than the phase speed. When the wavelength is infinite, RCW yields an algebraic solitary wave. Depending on the surface tension, the solitary wave involves one or two interfaces: a wave of depression; a wave of depression with a pocket of air; a wave of elevation with a pocket of air. Solitary waves are found for all values of the surface tension. However, this does not necessarily mean that these waves are solutions of the exact equations. Moreover, RCW approximate solitary waves always present a dipole singularity. It is also shown that a cnoidal wave in deep water can be rewritten as a periodic distribution of dipoles, each dipole representing an algebraic solitary wave. This provides a new paradigm for descriptions of water wave phenomena.},

In Lake Annecy, the lacustrine s.s. (non-proglacial) part of a 40 meters-thick rhythmic sediment pile has been investigated for this purpose by CLIMASILAC coring. For the last 15,000 to 20,000 years, 50 sedimentary “events” have been detected, with the most frequent time-recurrence intervals from 1 to 5 centuries. These events appear to have been concentrated during the deglaciation period. Thus, different factors could be responsible for the subsequent decrease: change of sediment composition and properties, modification of slope instability related to the latter and to modification in the catchment area, and decrease of regional seismic activity. Following the third possibility, the period of high reworking frequency, coeval with the main glacial melting, should be related to a glacio-isostatic rebound. On the other hand, the scarce “events” registered for the Holocene could represent the record of a longer term (tectonic) seismicity.},

   abstract = {The Korteweg-de Vries (KdV) equation has been generalized by Rosenau and Hyman 3 to a class of partial differential equations (PDEs) which has solitary wave solution with compact support. These solitary wave solutions are called compactons. Compactons are solitary waves with the remarkable soliton property, that after colliding with other compactons, they reemerge with the same coherent shape. These particle like waves exhibit elastic collision that are similar to the soliton interaction associated with completely integrable systems. The point where two compactons collide are marked by a creation of low amplitude compacton-anticompacton pair. These equations have only a finite number of local consevation laws. In this paper, an implicit numerical method has been developed to solve the K(2, 3) equation. Accuracy and stability of the method have been studied. The analytical solution and the conserved quantities are used to assess the accuracy of the suggested method. The numerical results have shown that this compacton exhibits true soliton behavior.},

@phdthesis{Dutykh2007a,
   abstract = {This thesis is devoted to tsunami wave modelling. The life of tsunami waves can be conditionally divided into three parts: generation, propagation and inundation (or run-up). In the first part of the manuscript we consider the generation process of such extreme waves. We examine various existing approaches to its modelling. Then we propose a few alternatives. The main conclusion is that the seismology/hydrodynamics coupling is poorly understood at the present time. The second chapter essentially deals with Boussinesq equations which are often used to model tsunami propagation and sometimes even run-up. More precisely, we discuss the importance, nature and inclusion of dissipative effects in long wave models. In the third chapter we slightly change the subject and turn to two-phase flows. The main purpose of this chapter is to propose an operational and simple set of equations in order to model wave impacts on coastal structures. Another important application includes wave sloshing in liquified natural gas carriers. Then, we discuss the numerical discretization of governing equations in the finite volume framework on unstructured meshes. Finally, this thesis deals with a topic which should be present in any textbook on hydrodynamics but it is not. We mean visco-potential flows. We propose a novel and sufficiently simple approach for weakly viscous flow modelling. We succeeded in keeping the simplicity of the classical potential flow formulation with the addition of viscous effects. In the case of finite depth we derive a correction term due to the presence of the bottom boundary layer. This term is nonlocal in time. Hence, the bottom boundary layer introduces a memory effect to the governing equations.},

@article{Leite1959,
   abstract = {An axially symmetric laminar flow of air was established in a long smooth pipe. This flow was steady up to Reynolds numbers of about 20,000, the capacity of the system. Small, nearly axially, symmetric disturbances were superimposed by longitudinally oscillating a thin sleeve adjacent to the inner wall of the pipe. Hot-wire anemometer measurements consisting of radial and longitudinal traverses were made downstream of the sleeve. These measurements indicated that within the Reynolds number range investigated (up to 13,000), the flow is stable to small disturbances. In general, the radial distribution of disturbance amplitudes was not independent of distance downstream; while the disturbances, as generated, exhibited imperfect axial symmetry, the non-symmetric part decayed more rapidly than the symmetric part. Results were interpreted in such a way that rates of propagation and rates of decay of the disturbances could be compared with those given by a recent theoretical stability analysis. It was found that the rates of decay are predicted fairly satisfactorily by the theory; however, the rates of propagation are not. In addition, it was found that transition to turbulent flow occurs whenever the amplitude of the disturbance exceeds a threshold value which decreases with increasing Reynolds number. Due to the departures from axial symmetry in the amplitude of the disturbance, it was not possible to obtain a quantitative measure of the threshold. A mathematical idealization of the disturbances, believed to be more akin to experimental perturbations than the classical model used in small-perturbation analyses, is proposed.},

   abstract = {The von Neumann method for stability analysis of linear waves in a uniform medium is a widely applied procedure. However, the method does not apply to stability of linear waves in a variable medium. Herein we describe instabilities due to variable depth for different Boussinesq equations, including the standard model by Peregrine and the popular generalization by Nwogu. Eigenmodes are first found for bathymetric features on the grid scale. For certain combinations of Boussinesq formulations and bottom profiles stability limits are found in closed form, otherwise numerical techniques are used for the eigenvalue problems. Naturally, the unstable modes in such settings must be considered to be as much a result of the difference method as of the underlying differential (Boussinesq) equations. Hence, modes are also computed for smooth depth profiles that are well resolved. Generally, the instabilities do not vanish with refined resolution. In some cases convergence is observed and we thus have indications of unstable solutions of the differential equations themselves. The stability properties differ strongly. While the standard Boussinesq equations seem perfectly stable, all the other formulations do display unstable modes. In most cases the instabilities are linked to steep bottom gradients and small grid increments. However, while a certain formulation, based on velocity potentials, is very prone to instability, the Boussinesq equations of Nwogu become unstable only under quite demanding conditions. Still, for the formulation of Nwogu, instabilities are probably inherent in the differential equations and are not a result of the numerical model.},

Numerical simulations are performed for different Ursell parameters and spectrum width. It is shown that the wave field relaxes to the stationary state (in statistical sense) with the almost uniform energy distribution in low frequency range (Rayleigh-Jeans spectrum). The wave field statistics differs from the Gaussian one. The growing of the positive skewness and non-monotonic behavior of the kurtosis with increase of the Ursell parameter are obtained. The probability of a large amplitude wave formation differs from the Rayleigh distribution.},

   abstract = {Although a wide range of mathematical techniques can apply to solving problems involving the interaction of waves with structures, few texts discuss those techniques within that context-most often they are presented without reference to any applications. Handbook of Mathematical Techniques for Wave/Structure Interactions brings together some of the most important techniques useful to applied mathematicians and engineers. Each chapter is dedicated to a particular technique, such as eigenfunction expansions, multipoles, integral equations, and Wiener-Hopf methods. Other chapters discuss approximation techniques and variational methods. The authors describe all of the techniques in terms of wave/structure interactions, with most illustrated by application to research problems. They provide detailed explanations of the important steps within the mathematical development, and, where possible, physical interpretations of mathematical results. Handbook of Mathematical Techniques for Wave/Structure Interactions effectively bridges the gap between the heavy computational methods preferred by some engineers and the more mathematical approach favored by others. These techniques provide a powerful means of dealing with wave/structure interactions, are readily applied to relevant problems, and illuminate those problems in a way that neither a purely computational approach nor a straight theoretical treatment can.},

With due care near the meniscus a boundary-layer Poincaré method is employed to give an alternative derivation for the rate of attenuation and to obtain in addition the frequency (or wave-number) shift due to viscosity.

It is an exhaustive monograph on turbulence in fluids in its theoretical and applied aspects, with many advanced developments using mathematical spectral methods (two-point closures like the EDQNM theory), direct-numerical simulations, and large-eddy simulations. The book is still of great actuality on a topic of the utmost importance for engineering and environmental applications, and presents a very detailed presentation of the field. The fourth edition incorporates new results coming from research work done since 1997. Many of these results come from direct and large-eddy simulations methods, which have provided significant advances in problems such as turbulent mixing or thermal exchanges (with and without gravity effects). Topics dealt with include: an introduction to turbulence in fluid mechanics; basic fluid dynamics; transition to turbulence; shear-flow turbulence; Fourier analysis for homogeneous turbulence; isotropic turbulence; phenomenology and simulations; analytical theories and stochastic models; two-dimensional turbulence; geostrophic turbulence; absolute-equilibrium ensembles; the statistical predictability theory; large-eddy simulations; and a section that explores developments towards real-world turbulence.},

About 40 minutes after the main shock, a huge tsunami attacked the coasts, several villages in East Java Province were damaged severely, and 223 persons perished. At Pancer Village about 70 percent of the houses were swept away and 121 persons were killed by the tsunami. The relationship between tsunami heights and distances from the source shows that the Hatori''s tsunami magnitude wasm=3, which seems to be larger for the earthquake magnitude. But we should not consider this an extraordinary event because it was pointed out byHatori (1994) that the magnitudes of tsunamis in the Indonesia-Philippine region generally exceed 1�2 grade larger than those of other regions.},

The equations of motion which govern the evolution of the barycenter of the landslide mass include various dissipative effects due to bottom friction, internal energy dissipation, and viscous drag. The surface waves are studied in the Boussinesq scaling, with time-dependent bathymetry. A numerical model for the Boussinesq equations is introduced which is able to handle time-dependent bottom topography, and the equations of motion for the landslide and surface waves are solved simultaneously. The numerical solver for the Boussinesq equations can also be restricted to implement a shallow-water solver, and the shallow-water and Boussinesq configurations are compared. A particular bathymetry is chosen to illustrate the general method, and it is found that the Boussinesq system predicts larger wave run-up than the shallow-water theory in the example treated in this paper. It also found that the finite fluid domain has a significant impact on the behaviour of the wave run-up.},

The secondary flow velocity field is measured and the trajectories of individual fluid particles in the standing wave are determined.

   abstract = {Based on numerical simulations presented in Part I, we derive predictive empirical equations describing tsunami generation by submarine mass failure (SMF) that are only valid in the vicinity of the tsunami sources. We give equations for slides and slumps, along with some cautions about their appropriate use. We further discuss results obtained here and in Part I and their practical application to case studies. We show that initial acceleration is the primary parameter describing SMF center of mass motion during tsunami generation. We explain an apparent paradox, raised in Part I, in slump center of mass motion, whereby the distance traveled is proportional to shear strength along the failure plane. We stress that the usefulness of predictive equations depends on the quality of the parameters they rely on. Parameter ranges are discussed in the paper, and we propose a method to estimate slump motion and shear strength and discuss SMF thickness to length values, for case studies. We derive the analytical tools needed to characterize SMF tsunami sources in propagation models. Specifically, we quantify three-dimensional (3D) effects on tsunami characteristic amplitude, and we propose an analytical method to specify initial 3D tsunami elevations, shortly after tsunami generation, in long wave tsunami propagation models. This corresponds to treating SMF tsunami sources like coseismic displacement tsunami sources. We conduct four case studies of SMF tsunamis and show that our predictive equations can provide rapid rough estimates of overall tsunami observations that might be useful in crisis situations, when time is too short to run propagation models. Thus, for each case, we show that the characteristic tsunami amplitude is a reasonable predictor of maximum runup in actual 3D geometry. We refer to the latter observation as the correspondence principle, which we propose to apply for rapid tsunami hazard assessment, in combination with the predictive tsunami amplitude equations.},

   abstract = {The north-western corner of Lake Le Bourget is situated along an active fault zone and accommodated a large sediment supply from the Rhone River until the end of the Late Glacial period. On the delta slope, the Holocene sheet drape that covers the largest buried mass wasting deposit (the HDU) shows undulations, small fractures and discontinuities that are attributed to downslope creep. Evidence for episodes of vigorous fluid expulsion is found in association with these discontinuities. All these features are rooted at the top of the HDU and occur along two specific isobaths. These observations indicate a close link between fractures and focused fluid flow. We suggest that focused fluid flow triggered by earthquakes facilitates the formation of small-scale faults that accommodate part of the downslope movement and eventually link up to form a head-scarp of a large slide (c. 10^7 m3).},

   abstract = {It is shown that the equations of motion of an ideal fluid with a free surface in the absence of both gravitational and capillary forces can be effectively solved in the approximation of small surface angles. It can be done by means of an analytical continuation of both the velocity potential on the surface and its elevation. For almost arbitrary initial conditions the system evolves to the formation of singularities in a finite time. Three kinds of singularities are shown to be possible. The first one is of the root character provided by the analytical behavior of the velocity potential. In this case the process of the singularity formation, representing some analog of the wave breaking, is described as a motion of branch points in the complex plane towards the real axis. The second type can be obtained as a result of the interaction of two movable branch points leading to the formation of wedges on the free surface. The third kind is associated with a motion in the complex plane of the singular points of the analytical continuation of the elevation, resulting in the appearance of strong singularities for the surface profile.},

A series of wave trains with added sidebands, and varying initial steepness, perturbed amplitudes and frequencies, are physically generated in a long wave flume. The experimental results directly confirm the stabilization theory of Segur et al. (J. Fluid Mech., vol. 539, 2005, pp. 229-271), i.e. dissipation can stabilize the Benjamin-Feir instability. Furthermore, the experiments reveal that the effect of dissipation on modulational instability depends strongly on the perturbation frequency. It is found that the effect of dissipation on the growth rates of the sidebands for the waves with higher perturbation frequencies is more evident than on those of waves with lower perturbation frequencies. In addition, numerical simulations based on Dysthe's equation with a linear damping term included, which is estimated from the experimental data, can predict the experimental results well if the momentum integral of the wave trains is conserved during evolution.},

The numerical scheme is applied to a number of wave and wave train configurations including longwave-shortwave interactions and the three-dimensional instability of waves with finite slope. The results are consistent with those obtained in other studies. One strength of the technique is that it can be applied to a variety of wave train and spectral configurations without modifying the code.},

This slow earthquake was hardly felt on Java, and wind waves breaking masked any preceding withdrawal of the water from the shoreline, making this tsunami difficult to detect before impact. An International Tsunami Survey Team was deployed within one week and the investigation covered more than 600 km of coastline. Measured tsunami heights and run-up distributions were uniform at 5 to 7 m along 200 km of coast; however there was a pronounced peak on the south coast of Nusa Kambangan, where the tsunami impact carved a sharp trimline in a forest at elevations up to 21 m and 1 km inland. Local flow depth exceeded 8 m along the elevated coastal plain between the beach and the hill slope. We infer that the focused tsunami and runup heights on the island suggest a possible local submarine slump or mass movement.},

   abstract = {A numerical method is developed for solution of the full nonlinear equations governing irrotational flow with a free surface and variable bed topography. It is applied to the unsteady motion of non-breaking water waves of arbitrary magnitude over a horizontal bed. All horizontal variation is approximated by truncated Fourier series. This and finite-difference representation of the time variation are the only necessary approximations. Although the method loses accuracy if the waves become sharp-crested at any stage, when applied to non-breaking waves the method is capable of high accuracy. The interaction of one solitary wave overtaking another was studied using the Fourier method. Results support experimental evidence for the applicability of the Korteweg-de Vries equation to this problem since the waves during interaction are long and low. However, some deviations from the theoretical predictions were observed - the overtaking high wave grew significantly at the expense of the low wave, and the predicted phase shift was found to be only roughly described by theory. A mechanism is suggested for all such solitary-wave interactions during which the high and fast rear wave passes fluid forward to the front wave, exchanging identities while the two waves have only partly coalesced; this explains the observed forward phase shift of the high wave. For solitary waves travelling in opposite directions, the interaction is quite different in that the amplitude of motion during interaction is large. A number of such interactions were studied using the Fourier method, and the waves after interaction were also found to be significantly modified - they were not steady waves of translation. There was a change of wave height and propagation speed, shown by the present results to be proportional to the cube of the initial wave height but not contained in third-order theoretical results. When the interaction is interpreted as a solitary wave being reflected by a wall, third-order theory is shown to provide excellent results for the maximum run-up at the wall, but to be in error in the phase change of the wave after reflection. In fact, it is shown that the spatial phase change depends strongly on the place at which it is measured because the reflected wave travels with a different speed. In view of this, it is suggested that the apparent time phase shift at the wall is the least-ambiguous measure of the change.},

The space of the controllable data for the associated linear system is determined for all values of the four parameters.

We confirm the existence of coherent states with internal fast and slow streaks commensurate in both structure and energy with known TWs using numerical simulations in a long pipe. These only occur, however, within less energetic regions of (localized) "puff" turbulence at low Reynolds numbers (Re=2000-2400), and not at all in (homogeneous) “slug” turbulence at Re=2800. This strongly suggests that all currently known TWs sit in an intermediate region of phase space between the laminar and turbulent states rather than being embedded within the turbulent attractor itself. New coherent fast streak states with strongly decelerated cores appear to populate the turbulent attractor instead.},

The shallow-water model describes well the properties of the generated tsunami waves for all regimes, except the resonance case. The nonlinear-dispersive model based on the forced Korteweg-de Vries equation is developed to describe the resonant mechanism of the tsunami wave generation by the atmospheric disturbances moving with near-critical speed (long wave speed). Some analytical solutions of the nonlinear dispersive model are obtained. They illustrate the different regimes of soliton generation and the focusing of frequency modulated wave packets.},

The laboratory experiments were carried out on topography consisting of a ramp and a series of humps. The results show a localized increase in deposit distribution downstream of the slope break and on the upslope of a hump. A numerical model is developed to predict the topographic effects on deposit distribution. The model, based on layer-averaged Navier–Stokes equations, is applied to the experiments, and the process of the topographic influence is analyzed. The preferential deposition downstream of the slope break is interpreted to result from deceleration of the flow, which increases deposit distribution through loss of capacity of the flow and longer duration of the flow passage. The former effect is more influential than the latter, while additional effects of a hydraulic jump may be imposed. Increased deposit on the upslope of a hump is attributed to partial blocking of the flow at the hump crest, as well as to the differential deposition due to deceleration on the upslope.},

At small slope (approx. less than 1/10) flow was found to be subcritical with negligible entrainment. As the slope increases, flow becomes supercritical and periodic interfacial instabilities appear. Growth and subsequent breakup of these instabilities were found to be the main mechanism for entrainment. Mean layer velocity away from the source can be estimated from the initial conditions and the angle of incline.},

The landslides in the southern part of Hading Bay could generate local tsunamis of more than 10 m. The circular-arc slip model proposed in this study for wave generation due to landslides shows better results than the subsidence model, It is, however, difficult to reproduce the tsunami runup height of 26.2 m at Riangkroko, which was extraordinarily high compared to other places. The wave propagation process on a sea bottom with a steep slope, as well as landslides, may be the cause of the amplification of tsunami at Riangkroko. The simulation model demonstrates that the reflected wave along the northeastern shore of Flores Island, accompanying a high hydraulic pressure, could be the main cause of severe damage in the southern coast of Babi Island.},

Concentrating on second order discretizations, several interesting schemes are constructed and studied. Our essential conclusions are that it is possible to design very stable, conservative difference schemes for the nonlinear, conservative KdV equation. Among the best of such schemes are methods which are symplectic or multisymplectic. Semi-explicit, symplectic schemes can be very effective in many situations. Compact box schemes are effective in ensuring that no artificial wiggles appear in the approximate solution. A family of box schemes is constructed, of which the multisymplectic box scheme is a prominent member, which are particularly stable on coarse space–time grids},

   abstract = {We analyze the multisymplectic Preissman scheme for the KdV equation with the periodic boundary condition and show that the unconvergence of the widely-used iterative methods to solve the resulting nonlinear algebra system of the Preissman scheme is due to the introduced potential function. A artificial numerical condition is added to the periodic boundary condition. The added boundary condition makes the numerical implementation of the multisymplectic Preissman scheme practical and is proved not to change the numerical solutions of the KdV equation. Based on our analysis, we derive some new schemes which are not restricted by the artificial boundary condition and more efficient than the Preissman scheme because of less computing cost and less computer storages. By eliminating the auxiliary variables, we also derive two schemes for the KdV equation, one is a 12-point scheme and the other is an 8-point scheme. As the byproducts, we present two new explicit schemes which are not multisymplectic but still have remarkable numerical stable property.},

The coupled problem forms a one-dimensional hyperbolic system of conservation laws with geometric source terms. The proposed numerical method combines the method of characteristics with a finite volume discretization of the system. The combined method is simple to implement and accurately resolves the governing equations without relying on Riemann problem solvers.

These states are obtained by forcing and dissipating a conservative dispersive wave equation at disparate scales to model physical forcing and dissipation, and by predicting the spectrum, often as a Kolmogorov-like power law, at intermediate scales. The mechanism for energy transfer in such systems is usually triads or quartets of waves. Here, we first derive a small-amplitude nonlinear dispersive equation (a finite-depth Benney-Luke-type equation), which we validate, analytically and numerically, by showing that it correctly captures the main deterministic aspects of gravity wave interactions: resonant quartets, Benjamin-Feir-type wave-packet stability, and wave-mean flow interactions. Numerically, this equation is easier to integrate than either the full problem or the Zakharov integral equation. Some additional features of wave interaction are discussed such as harmonic generation in shallow water. We then perform long time computations on the forced-dissipated model equation and compute statistical quantities of interest, which we compare to existing predictions. The forward cascade yields a spectrum close to the prediction of Zakharov, and the inverse cascade does not.},

   abstract = {We consider the evolution of packets of water waves that travel predominantly in one direction, but in which the wave amplitudes are modulated slowly in both horizontal directions. Two separate models are discussed, depending on whether or not the waves are long in comparison with the fluid depth. These models are two-dimensional generalizations of the Korteweg-de Vries equation (for long waves) and the cubic nonlinear Schrödinger equation (for short waves). In either case, we find that the two-dimensional evolution of the wave packets depends fundamentally on the dimensionless surface tension and fluid depth. In particular, for the long waves, one-dimensional (KdV) solitons become unstable with respect to even longer transverse perturbations when the surface-tension parameter becomes large enough, i.e. in very thin sheets of water. Two-dimensional long waves (‘lumps’) that decay algebraically in all horizontal directions and interact like solitons exist only when the one-dimensional solitons are found to be unstable. The most dramatic consequence of surface tension and depth, however, occurs for capillary-type waves in sufficiently deep water. Here a packet of waves that are everywhere small (but not infinitesimal) and modulated in both horizontal dimensions can ‘focus’ in a finite time, producing a region in which the wave amplitudes are finite. This nonlinear instability should be stronger and more apparent than the linear instabilities examined to date; it should be readily observable. Another feature of the evolution of short wave packets in two dimensions is that all one-dimensional solitons are unstable with respect to long transverse perturbations. Finally, we identify some exact similarity solutions to the evolution equations.},

The self-sustaining process consists of streamwise rolls that redistribute the mean shear to create streaks that wiggle to maintain the rolls. The process is analyzed and shown to be remarkably insensitive to whether there is no-slip or free-slip at the walls. A low-order model of the process is derived from the Navier-Stokes equations for a sinusoidal shear flow. The model has two unstable steady solutions above a critical Reynolds number, in addition to the stable laminar flow. For some parameter values, there is a second critical Reynolds number at which a homoclinic bifurcation gives rise to a stable periodic solution. This suggests a direct link between unstable steady solutions and almost periodic solutions that have been computed in plane Couette flow. It is argued that this self-sustaining process is responsible for the bifurcation of shear flows at low Reynolds numbers and perhaps also for controlling the near-wall region of turbulent shear flows at higher Reynolds numbers.},

   abstract = {We discuss the application of a finite volume method to morphodynamic models on unstructured triangular meshes. The model is based on coupling the shallow water equations for the hydrodynamics with a sediment transport equation for the morphodynamics. The finite volume method is formulated for the quasi-steady approach and the coupled approach. In the first approach, the steady hydrodynamic state is calculated first and the corresponding water velocity is used in the sediment transport equation to be solved subsequently. The second approach solves the coupled hydrodynamics and sediment transport system within the same time step. The gradient fluxes are discretized using a modified Roe's scheme incorporating the sign of the Jacobian matrix in the morphodynamic system. A well-balanced discretization is used for the treatment of source terms. We also describe an adaptive procedure in the finite volume method by monitoring the bed-load in the computational domain during its transport process. The method uses unstructured meshes, incorporates upwinded numerical fluxes and slope limiters to provide sharp resolution of steep bed gradients that may form in the approximate solution. Numerical results are shown for a test problem in the evolution of an initially hump-shaped bed in a squared channel. For the considered morphodynamical regimes, the obtained results point out that the coupled approach performs better than the quasi-steady approach only when the bed-load rapidly interacts with the hydrodynamics.},

   abstract = {Summary~~A family of one-dimensional nonlinear dispersive wave equations is introduced as a model for assessing the validity of weak turbulence theory for random waves in an unambiguous and transparent fashion. These models have an explicitly solvable weak turbulence theory which is developed here, with Kolmogorov-type wave number spectra exhibiting interesting dependence on parameters in the equations. These predictions of weak turbulence theory are compared with numerical solutions with damping and driving that exhibit a statistical inertial scaling range over as much as two decades in wave number. It is established that the quasi-Gaussian random phase hypothesis of weak turbulence theory is an excellent approximation in the numerical statistical steady state. Nevertheless, the predictions of weak turbulence theory fail and yield a much flatter (k1/3) spectrum compared with the steeper (k3/4) spectrum observed in the numerical statistical steady state. The reasons for the failure of weak turbulence theory in this context are elucidated here. Finally, an inertial range closure and scaling theory is developed which successfully predicts the inertial range exponents observed in the numerical statistical steady states.},

   abstract = {Experiments on the entrainment of bed sediment into suspension by density underflows are described. The density underflows were created by allowing saline water to move as a steady, continuous current under a body of essentially stagnant fresh water. The bed slope was set at 0.08. Two grades of fine crushed coal, with geometric mean sizes of 100 μm and 180 μm, were placed in a trough in the bed with a length of 2 m, over which the density currents passed. Measurements of profiles of flow velocity and concentration of suspended sediment allowed for a back calculation of boundary shear stress and the rate of sediment entrainment from the equations of momentum and mass balance. Two techniques for removing the effect of form drag from the boundary shear stress were explored. The resulting data were used to compare sediment entrainment rates due to density underflows with those observed in open channels. It appears possible to make rather modest adjustments in an existing predictive relation for sediment entrainment in open channels, so as to predict the case pertaining to density underflows as well.},

One-dimensional numerical simulations in the framework of the nonlinear shallow water equations are used to investigate the boundary value problem for plane and nontrivial beaches. Monochromatic waves, as well as virtual wave-gage recordings from real tsunami simulations, are used as forcing conditions to the boundary value problem. Resonant phenomena between the incident wavelength and the beach slope are found to occur, which result in enhanced run-up of nonleading waves. The evolution of energy reveals the existence of a quasiperiodic state for the case of sinusoidal waves. Dispersion is found to slightly reduce the value of maximum run-up but not to change the overall picture. Run-up amplification occurs for both leading elevation and depression waves.},

We present laboratory experiments to address this controversy. Growth rates of modulational perturbations are compared to predictions from: (i) inviscid coupled nonlinear Schrödinger (NLS) equations, according to which the patterns are unstable and (ii) dissipative coupled NLS equations, according to which they are linearly stable. For bi-periodic wave patterns of small amplitude and nearly permanent form, we find that the dissipative model predicts the experimental observations more accurately. Hence, our experiments support the claim that these bi-periodic wave patterns are linearly stable in the presence of damping. For bi-periodic wave patterns of large enough amplitude or subject to large enough perturbations, both models fail to predict accurately the observed behaviour, which includes frequency downshifting.},

The rising demand for higher safety measures has given new impetus to the development of mitigation technology and has given rise to a new scientific area entirely devoted to snow and avalanches. This paper summarises the paramount features of avalanches (formation and motion) and outlines the main approaches used for describing their movement. We do not tackle specific problems related to snow mechanics and avalanche forecasting.

The tsunami travel times poorly constrain the source area, probably because shallow bathymetry near these gauges is not well known. Inversion of tsunami waveforms, however, reveals that the tsunami source was about 200 km long. The largest slip, about 2.5 m for instantaneous rupture model, was located about 150 km east of the epicenter. Most of the slip occurred on shallow parts of the fault, indicating that this earthquake shares the same characteristics with �tsunami earthquakes� which generate abnormally large tsunamis compared with ground shaking. The slip distribution yields a total seismic moment of 7.0 � 1020 Nm (Mw = 7.8).},

   abstract = {On the 16th of October 1979, a part of the Nice new harbour extension, close to the Nice international airport (French Riviera), slumped into the Mediterranean Sea during landfilling operations. A submarine slide with initial volume close to seashore of about 10 millions m3, which could have evolved later into an avalanche, was followed by a small tsunami, noticed by several witnesses in the “Baie des Anges.” The maximum tsunami effects were observed 10 km from the slide location near Antibes city, which was inundated. Previous analyses used rough approximate methods and produced models which did not conveniently fit data. In this paper, both the slide and the generated water waves are numerically simulated on the basis of the shallow water approximation. The landslide is assimilated to a heavy Newtonian homogeneous fluid downslope under gravity. Water waves are generated by sea-bottom displacements induced by the landslide. Taking into account a very accurate multibeam bathymetric map, the Nice slide of 10 millions m3 is simulated by this model. The numerical results are generally consistent with the observed hydraulic local effects in front of the Nice airport, however they are not in agreement in the far field. A larger and deeper landslide 2 km off Nice airport is tested to quantitatively study the effects of the landslide volume on water waves generation.},

The formulation and implementation of the methods focus on some specific points of the problem: on the one hand, the approximation of the nonlocal term is accomplished by Fourier techniques, which determine the spatial discretization used in the experiments. On the other hand, in the numerical continuation procedure suggested by the derivation of the model and already discussed in the literature, several algorithms for solving the nonlinear systems are described and implemented: the Petviashvili method, the Preconditioned Conjugate Gradient Newton method and two Squared-Operator methods. A comparative study of these algorithms is made in the case of the Benjamin equation; Newton's method combined with Preconditioned Conjugate Gradient techniques, emerges as the most efficient. The resulting numerical profiles are shown to have a high accuracy as travelling-wave solutions when they are used as initial conditions in a time-stepping procedure for the Benjamin equation. The paper also explores the generation of multi-pulse solitary waves.},

Slow evolution equations describing this wave interaction problem are obtained via Whitham’s averaged variational principle. Autoresonant solutions of these equations are found and, locally, comprise adiabatically varying quasiuniform wave train solutions of the decoupled problem. At the same time, the waves are globally phase locked in an extended region of space-time despite the variation of the system’s parameters. Conditions for entering and sustaining this multidimensional autoresonance are the internal resonant excitation of one of the coupled waves and sufficient adiabaticity and nonlinearity of the problem. These conditions have their origin in a similar adiabatic resonance problem in nonlinear dynamics. The theory is illustrated by an example of the autoresonance in a system of coupled sine-Gordon equations.},

   abstract = {The waves generated in a two-dimensional fluid domain of infinite lateral extent and uniform depth by a deformation of the bounding solid boundary are investigated both theoretically and experimentally. An integral solution is developed for an arbitrary bed displacement (in space and time) on the basis of a linear approximation of the complete (nonlinear) description of wave motion. Experimental and theoretical results are presented for two specific deformations of the bed; the spatial variation of each bed displacement consists of a block section of the bed moving vertically either up or down while the time-displacement history of the block section is varied. The presentation of results is divided into two sections based on two regions of the fluid domain: a generation region in which the bed deformation occurs and a downstream region where the bed position remains stationary for all time. The applicability of the linear approximation in the generation region is investigated both theoretically and experimentally; results are presented which enable certain gross features of the primary wave leaving this region to be determined when the magnitudes of parameters which characterize the bed displacement are known. The results indicate that the primary restriction on the applicability of the linear theory during the bed deformation is that the total amplitude of the bed displacement must remain small compared with the uniform water depth; even this restriction can be relaxed for one type of bed motion. Wave behaviour in the downstream region of the fluid domain is discussed with emphasis on the gradual growth of nonlinear effects relative to frequency dispersion duringpropagationand the subsequent breakdown of the linear theory. A method is presented for finding the wave behaviour in the far field of the downstream region, where the effects of nonlinearities and frequency dispersion have become about equal. This method is based on the use of a model equation in the far field (which includes both linear and nonlinear effects in an approximate manner) first used by Peregrine (1966) and morerecently advocated by Ben jamin, Bona & Mahony (1972) as a preferable model to the more commonly used equation of Korteweg & de Vries (1895). An input-output approach is illustrated for the numerical solution of this equation where the input is computed from the linear theory in its region of applicability. Computations are presented and compared with experiment for the case of a positive bed displacement where the net volume of the generated wave is finite and positive; the results demonstrate the evolution of a train of solitary waves (solitons) ordered by amplitude followed by a dispersive train of oscillatory waves. The case of a negative bed displacement in which the net wave volume is finite and negative (and the initial wave is negative almost everywhere) is also investigated; the results suggest that only a dispersive train of waves evolves (no solitons) for this case.},

@article{Tinti2005,
   abstract = {On the 30th of December 2002 two tsunamis were generated only 7 min apart in Stromboli, southern Tyrrhenian Sea, Italy. They represented the peak of a volcanic crisis that started 2 days before with a large emission of lava flows from a lateral vent that opened some hundreds of meters below the summit craters. Both tsunamis were produced by landslides that detached from the Sciara del Fuoco. This is a morphological scar and is the result of the last collapse of the northwestern flank of the volcanic edifice, that occurred less than 5 ka B.P. The first tsunami was due to a submarine mass movement that started very close to the coastline and that involved about 20106 m3 of material. The second tsunami was engendered by a subaerial landslide that detached at about 500 m above sea level and that involved a volume estimated at 49106 m3. The latter landslide can be seen as the retrogressive continuation of the first failure. The tsunamis were not perceived as distinct events by most people. They attacked all the coasts of Stromboli within a few minutes and arrived at the neighbouring island of Panarea, 20 km SSW of Stromboli, in less than 5 min. The tsunamis caused severe damage at Stromboli. In this work, the two tsunamis are studied by means of numerical simulations that use two distinct models, one for the landslides and one for the water waves. The motion of the sliding bodies is computed by means of a Lagrangian approach that partitions the mass into a set of blocks: we use both one-dimensional and two-dimensional schemes. The landslide model calculates the instantaneous rate of the vertical displacement of the sea surface caused by the motion of the underwater slide. This is included in the governing equations of the tsunami, which are solved by means of a finite-element (FE) technique. The tsunami is computed on two different grids formed by triangular elements, one covering the near-field around Stromboli and the other also including the island of Panarea. The simulations show that the main tsunamigenic potential of the slides is restricted to the first tens of seconds of their motion when they interact with the shallow-water coastal area, and that it diminishes drastically in deep water. The simulations explain how the tsunamis that are generated in the Sciara del Fuoco area, are able to attack the entire coastline of Stromboli with larger effects on the northern coast than on the southern. Strong refraction and bending of the tsunami fronts is due to the large near-shore bathymetric gradient, which is also responsible for the trapping of the waves and for the persistence of the oscillations. Further, the first tsunami produces large waves and runup heights comparable with the observations. The simulated second tsunami is only slightly smaller, though it was induced by a mass that is approximately one third of the first. The arrival of the first tsunami is negative, in accordance with most eyewitness reports. Conversely, the leading wave of the second tsunami is positive.},

   abstract = {On November18, 1929, a M=7.2 earthquake occurred at the southern edge of the GrandBanks, 280 km south of Newfoundland. The earthquake triggered a large submarine slope failure (200 km3), which was transformed into a turbidity current carrying mud and sand eastward up to 1000 km at estimated speeds of about 60-100 km/h, breaking 12 telegraph cables. The tsunamigenerated by this failure killed 28 people, making it the most catastrophic tsunami in Canadian history. Tsunami waves also were observed along other parts of the Atlantic coast of Canada and the United States. Waves crossing the Atlantic were recorded on the coasts of Portugal and the Azores Islands. Tsunami waves had amplitudes of 3-8 m and runup of up to 13 m along the coast of the Burin Peninsula (Newfoundland). To simulate the slide-generatedtsunami from this event, our initial analysis uses a shallow-water model; the slide was assumed to be a viscous, incompressible fluid layer; water was inviscid and incompressible. The preliminary results of the numerical modeling are encouraging, with computed and observed tsunami arrival times in reasonable agreement.},

The key and novel moment here is the analysis of the runup of a certain class of asymmetric waves, the face slope steepness of which exceeds the back slope steepness. Shown is that the runup height increases when the relative face slope steepness increases whereas the rundown weakly depends on the steepness. The results partially explain why the tsunami waves with the steep front (as it was for the 2004 tsunami in the Indian Ocean) penetrate deeper into inland compared with symmetric waves of the same height and length.},

We prove that up to times of the order of 1/epsilon(2), the solution decomposes into the sum of a randomly modulated soliton, and a small remainder, and we derive the equations for the modulation parameters. We prove in addition that the first order part of the remainder converges, as E tends to zero, to a Gaussian process, which satisfies an additively perturbed linear equation.

   abstract = {Resonant driving of the nonlinear Schrödinger (NLS) equation by small-amplitude oscillations or waves with adiabatically varying frequencies and/or wave vectors is proposed as a method of excitation and control of wave-type solutions of the system. The idea is based on the autoresonance phenomenon, i.e., a continuous nonlinear phase locking between the solutions of the NLS equation and the driving oscillations, despite the space-time variation of the parameters of the driver. We illustrate this phenomenon in the examples of excitation of plane and standing waves in the driven NLS system, where one varies the driver parameters in time or space. The relation of autoresonance in these applications to the corresponding problems in nonlinear dynamics is outlined. One of these dynamical problems comprises a different type of multifrequency autoresonance in a Hamiltonian system with two degrees of freedom. The averaged variational principle is used in studying the problem of autoresonant excitation and stabilization of more general cnoidal solutions of the NLS equation.},

I 345 (2007) 113-118] we presented a novel visco-potential free-surface flows formulation. The governing equations contain local and nonlocal dissipative terms. From physical point of view, local dissipation terms come from molecular viscosity but in practical computations, rather eddy viscosity should be used. On the other hand, nonlocal dissipative term represents a correction due to the presence of a bottom boundary layer. Using the standard procedure of Boussinesq equations derivation, we come to nonlocal long wave equations. In this article we analyze dispersion relation properties of proposed models. The effect of nonlocal term on solitary and linear progressive waves attenuation is investigated. Finally, we present some computations with viscous Boussinesq equations solved by a Fourier type spectral method.},

   abstract = {The Unimak (eastern Aleutians) earthquake of April1, 1946 is an enigma. The earthquake (MS=7.1) produced a disproportionately large tsunami (Mt=9.3) which killed 167 people. The tsunami was highly directional, and projected its largest waves along a beam perpendicular to the Aleutian arc. Those waves passed just east of the Hawaiian Islands, ran the length of the Pacific, and were still large when they ran ashore in Antarctica. In the near field, the tsunami had very high runup (42 m at Scotch Cap) but rapid lateral decay (6 m at Sanak Village, 120 km to the east). No earthquake source can simultaneously explain the narrow beam of large waves in the far field and the rapid variation in near-source runup. The slow rupture, the tsunami directivity, the rapid variation in near-source wave heights, the period of the waves, and the strong T-phase generation, together suggest an earthquake-triggered landslide rather than a purely tectonic source. From USGS GLORIA imagery we have identified a candidate landslide within the aftershock zone of 1946. The slide bites into the Aleutian shelf at a depth of only 120 m, is 25 km across, 65 km long, and has a volume of 200–300 km3. A slide with these dimensions would produce a tsunami matching the observations while still satisfying the seismic data. Such slope failures appear to be common along the Aleutian forearc, which has serious implications for tsunami warning.},

Third, this equation is solved using Petviashvili’s iterations together with pseudo-spectral discretisation. This method has a super-linear complexity, since the most demanding operations can be performed using a FFT algorithm. Moreover, when this algorithm is combined with the multi-precision floating point computations, the results can be obtained to any arbitrary accuracy.},

The quantity to be controlled is the trace of the solution into an open subdomain and at a given time, when the right hand side source term is known. The mapping that associates this trace to the shape of the domain is nonlinear. We show (i) an approximate controllability property for the linearized parabolic problem and (ii) an exact local controllability property for the linearized and the nonlinear equations in the hyperbolic case. We then address the same questions in the context of a finite difference spatial semi-discretization in both the parabolic and hyperbolic problems. In this discretized case again we prove a local controllability result for the parabolic problem, and an exact controllability for the hyperbolic case, applying a local surjectivity theorem together with a unique continuation property of the underlying adjoint discrete system.},

   abstract = {Recent catastrophic tsunamis at Flores Island, Indonesia (1992), Skagway, Alaska (1994), Papua New Guinea (1998), and Izmit, Turkey (1999) have significantly increased scientific interest in landslides and slide-generated tsunamis. Theoretical investigations and laboratory modeling further indicate that purely submarine landslides are ineffective at tsunami generation compared with subaerial slides. In the present study, we undertook several numerical experiments to examine the influence of the subaerial component of slides on surface wave generation and to compare the tsunami generation efficiency of viscous and rigid-body slide models. We found that a rigid-body slide produces much higher tsunami waves than a viscous (liquid) slide. The maximum wave height and energy of generated surface waves were found to depend on various slide parameters and factors, including slide volume, density, position, and slope angle. For a rigid-body slide, the higher the initial slide above sea level, the higher the generated waves. For a viscous slide, there is an optimal slide position (elevation) which produces the largest waves. An increase in slide volume, density, and slope angle always increases the energy of the generated waves. The added volume associated with a subaerial slide entering the water is one of the reasons that subaerial slides are much more effective tsunami generators than submarine slides. The critical parameter determining the generation of surface waves is the Froude number, Fr (the ratio between slide and wave speeds). The most efficient generation occurs near resonance when Fr = 1.0. For purely submarine slides with 2.0 g cm-3, the Froude number is always less than unity and resonance coupling of slides and surface waves is physically impossible. For subaerial slides there is always a resonant point (in time and space) where Fr = 1.0 for which there is a significant transfer of energy from a slide into surface waves. This resonant effect is the second reason that subaerial slides are much more important for tsunami generation than submarine slides.},

Special travelling wave solutions of this compact equation are numerically constructed using the Petviashvili method. Their stability properties are also investigated. In particular, unstable travelling waves with wedge-type singularities, namely peakons, are numerically discovered. To gain insight into the properties of these singular solutions, we also consider the academic case of a perturbed version of the compact equation, for which analytical peakons with exponential shape are derived. Finally, by means of an accurate Fourier-type spectral scheme it is found that smooth solitary waves appear to collide elastically, suggesting the integrability of the Zakharov equation.},

The generation of tsunamis by submarine mass failure had been considered a rare phenomenon which had aroused virtually no attention in terms of tsunami hazard mitigation. We report on recently acquired high–resolution seismic reflection data which yield new images of a large underwater slump, coincident with photographic and bathymetric evidence of the same feature, suspected of having generated the tsunami. T–phase records from an unblocked hydrophone at Wake Island provide new evidence for the timing of the slump. By merging geological data with hydrodynamic modelling, we reproduce the observed tsunami amplitude and timing in a manner consistent with eyewitness accounts. Submarine mass failure is predicted based on fundamental geological and geotechnical information.},

   abstract = {This paper presents the results of laboratory experiments and numerical simulations carried out in order to understand the mechanism of sediment-wave formation by turbidity currents. Experimental turbidity currents were generated in a 10-m-long laboratory flume, so as to investigate the topographic effects of slope and ridges on turbidite deposition. The results indicate that preferential deposition occurs on the upstream side of the ridges. This preferential deposition is considered to result in possible upstream migration of the topography, a common feature of deep-sea sediment waves, provided that such deposition were repeated. The preferential deposition occurred under a subcritical turbidity current, implying that antidune flow conditions (0.844<Fr<1.77) are not necessarily required for upstream migration of the bedforms. A numerical simulation using layer-averaged Navier–Stokes equations is successfully applied to the laboratory experiments, and then to deep-sea turbidity currents. The numerical model predicts the formation of a wavy structure in a sequence of thousands of turbidites, with wave dimensions and internal architecture similar to deep-sea sediment waves. The wavy structure is interpreted to form as a succession of mounds, each of which grows individually rather than simultaneously as a sinusoidal wave. Each mound is developed by preferential deposition downstream of a slope break, which in turn generates a new slope break on its downstream side flank. Upstream migration of the waveform results from differential deposition between the upstream and downstream sides of the mounds. These results indicate that neither antidunes nor lee-waves are necessary for the formation and upstream migration of the wavy structure. Wave formation as a series of individual mounds can be considered as an origin for relatively small sediment-wave fields, because no more than 4–5 crests are formed in the model predictions. It is suggested that more extensive sediment-wave fields can be developed by turbidite deposition on an initially undulating bottom, which results in upstream migration by differential deposition, and downstream extension of the wave field by mound formation progressively further downstream.},

Comparison of the observed and computed tsunami waveforms indicates that the use of detailed bathymetry data with a small grid size is more effective than to include nonlinear terms in tsunami computation. Linear computation overestimates the amplitude for the later phase than the first arrival, particularly when the amplitude becomes large. The computed amplitudes along the coast from nonlinear computation are much smaller than the observed tsunami runup heights; the average ratio, or the amplification factor, is estimated to be 3 in the present case when the grid size of 1 minute is used. The factor however may depend on the grid size for the computation.},

This field does not appear to have a pyramidal structure, like the best of physics. We have very few great hypotheses. Most of our experiments are exploratory experiments. What does this mean? We believe it means that, even after 100 years, turbulence studies are still in their infancy. We are naturalists, observing butterflies in the wild. We are still discovering how turbulence behaves, in many respects. We do have a crude, practical, working understanding of many turbulence phenomena but certainly nothing approaching a comprehensive theory, and nothing that will provide predictions of an accuracy demanded by designers.},

   abstract = {In the study of ocean wave impact on structures, one often uses Froude scaling since the dominant force is gravity. However the presence of trapped or entrained air in the water can significantly modify wave impacts. When air is entrained in water in the form of small bubbles, the acoustic properties in the water change dramatically. While some work has been done to study small-amplitude disturbances in such mixtures, little work has been done on large disturbances in air-water mixtures. We propose a basic two-fluid model in which both fluids share the same velocities and analyze some of its properties. It is shown that this model can successfully mimic water-wave impacts on coastal structures. The governing equations are discretized by a second-order finite-volume method. Numerical results are presented for two examples: the dam break problem and the drop test problem. The results suggest that this basic model can be used to study violent aerated flows, especially by providing fast qualitative estimates.},

   abstract = {Experiments have been undertaken to investigate dam-break flows where a thin plate separating water at different levels is withdrawn impulsively in a vertically upwards direction. Depth ratios of 0, 0.1 and 0.45 were investigated for two larger depth values of 10 cm and 36 cm. The resulting sequence of surface profiles is shown to satisfy approximately Froude scaling. For the dry-bed case a horizontal jet forms at small times and for the other cases a vertical, mushroom-like jet occurs, none of which have been observed previously. We analyse the initial-release problem in which the plate is instantaneously removed or dissolved. Although this shows singular behaviour, jet-like formations are predicted. Artificially smoothing out the singularity enables a fully nonlinear, potential-flow computation to follow the jet formation for small times. There is qualitative agreement between theory and experiment. In the experiments, after a bore has developed downstream as a result of highly complex flow interactions, the surface profiles agree remarkably well with exact solutions of the shallow-water equations which assume hydrostatic pressure and uniform velocity over depth.},

Holes are deep troughs which occur before and/or after the largest rogue crests. The dynamical behavior of these giant waves is here addressed as solutions of the nonlinear Schrödinger equation in both 1+1 and 2+1 dimensions. We discuss analytical results for 1+1 dimensions and demonstrate numerically, for certain sets of initial conditions, the ubiquitous occurrence of rogue waves and holes in 2+1 spatial dimensions. A typical wave field evidently consists of a background of stable wave modes punctuated by the intermittent upthrusting of unstable rogue waves.},

   abstract = {The stability of a train of nonlinear gravity-capillary waves on the surface of an ideal fluid of infinite depth is considered. An evolution equation is derived for the wave envelope, which is correct to fourth order in the wave steepness. The derivation is made from the Zakharov equation under the assumption of a narrow band of waves, and including the full form of the interaction coefficient for gravity-capillary waves. It is assumed that conditions are away from subharmonic resonant wavelengths. Just as was found by K. B. Dysthe (Proc. R. Soc. Lond. A 369 (1979)) for pure gravity waves, the main difference from the third-order evolution equation is, as far as stability is concerned, the introduction of a mean flow response. There is a band of waves that remains stable to fourth order. In general the mean flow effects for pure capillary waves are of opposite sign to those of pure gravity waves. The second-order corrections to first-order stability properties are shown to depend on the interaction between the mean flow and the envelope frequency-dispersion term in the governing equation. The results are shown to be in agreement with some recent computations of the full problem for sufficiently small values of the wave steepness.},

It is shown that the initial stages in the formation of so-called spikes, observed in many experiments, may be described very well by the asymptotic theory. These flashes-spikes are shown to be (in certain regimes) possible solitons of the boundary layer and governed by the integral-differential Benjamin-Ono equation. Properties of the spike-solitons, obtained both theoretically and experimentally in the quasi-planar stages of their development, are presented. Features of the disturbance behaviour connected with the subsequent development of three-dimensionality are also discussed, as are the effects of viscosity and shorter lengthscales. The main conclusion of the work concerns the hypothesis of the possible soliton nature of the flashes-spikes (within limits), which seems reliably corroborated by the good agreement found between the theory and the experimental data.},

   abstract = {In the study of ocean wave impact on structures, one often uses Froude scaling since the dominant force is gravity. However the presence of trapped or entrained air in the water can significantly modify wave impacts. When air is entrained in water in the form of small bubbles, the acoustic properties in the water change dramatically and for example the speed of sound in the mixture is much smaller than in pure water, and even smaller than in pure air. While some work has been done to study small-amplitude disturbances in such mixtures, little work has been done on large disturbances in air-water mixtures. We propose a basic two-fluid model in which both fluids share the same velocities. It is shown that this model can successfully mimic water wave impacts on coastal structures. Even though this is a model without interface, waves can occur. Their dispersion relation is discussed and the formal limit of pure phases (interfacial waves) is considered. The governing equations are discretized by a second-order finite volume method. Numerical results are presented. It is shown that this basic model can be used to study violent aerated flows, especially by providing fast qualitative estimates.},

We derive effective evolution equations for the soliton parameter by applying a perturbation theory of the inverse scattering transform and limit theorems of stochastic calculus. Original results are derived that are very different compared to a randomly perturbed Nonlinear Schrodinger equation. First the emission of a soliton gas is proved to be a very general feature. Second some perturbations are shown to involve a speeding-up of the soliton, instead of the decay that is usually observed in random media.},

   abstract = {Successfully modelling flows over a spillway and on strongly vertically curved bottoms is a challenge for any depth-integrated model. This type of computation requires the use of axes properly inclined along the mean flow direction in the vertical plane and a modelling of curvature effects. The proposed generalized model performs such computations by means of suitable curvilinear coordinates in the vertical plane, leading to a fully integrated approach. This means that the flows in the upstream reservoir, on the spillway, in the stilling basin and in the downstream river reach are all handled in a single simulation. The velocity profile is generalized in comparison with the uniform one usually assumed in the classical shallow water equations. The pressure distribution is modified as a function of the bottom curvature and is thus not purely hydrostatic. Representative test cases, as well as the application of the extended model to the design of a large hydraulic structure in Belgium, lead to satisfactory validation results},

   abstract = {In this paper the interchange flow between two reservoirs connected by a contraction and containing fluid of different densities is considered. The effect of the boundary layers on the floor and walls of the contraction on the depth of flow in the contraction is discussed for the case of single layer flowing from one reservoir to the other. Next the theory for a denser layer plunging under a stationary layer is developed. In this case there is a discontinuity at the point of intersection of the surfaces of the flowing and the stationary fluids and there are three possible flow régimes depending on whether this discontinuity occurs at, downstream of, or upstream of the contraction. Finally, the case where there is an interchange flow with fluid flowing from each reservoir into the other is introduced. This latter theory parallels that developed by Wood (1968) for the case of two layers flowing from one reservoir through a contraction into another reservoir and as in this case there are two points of control, one at the position of minimum width and one (the virtual point of control) away from this position of minimum width. Experiments are described for a single layer flowing through the contraction and the results of these are used to obtain an indication of the accuracy that could be expected from the experiments with the more complicated exchange flow. The experiments with the exchange flow verified the major elements of the theory.},

   abstract = {Even though wave run-up is not a new subject, until recently analytical and numerical studies of long wave run-up on a plane beach have failed to identify the existence of resonant regimes. Furthermore, it was a common belief that the leading wave will result in the maximum runup. Stefanakis et al. (2011) underlined the importance of resonant long wave interactions during run-up and run-down. In the current paper we provide additional results with the use of one-dimensional numerical simulations in the framework of the nonlinear shallow water equations with boundary forcing for plane and nontrivial beaches. Several wave profiles are used as forcing conditions to the boundary value problem. Resonant interactions between incident and receding waves are found to occur, depending on the beach slope and the wavelength, and result in enhanced run-up of non-leading waves.

   abstract = {The StoreggaSlide occurred 8200 years ago and was the last megaslide in this region where similar slides have occurred with intervals of approximately 100 ky since the onset of continental shelf glaciations at 0.5 Ma. A geological model for the Plio-Pleistocene of the area explains the large scale sliding as a response to climatic variability, and the seismic stratigraphy indicates that sliding occurs at the end of a glaciation or soon after the deglaciation. The slides are in general translational with the failure planes related to strain softening behaviour of marine clay layers. The destabilisation prior to the slide is related to rapid loading from glacial deposits with generation of excess pore pressure and reduction of the effective shear strength in the underlying clays. Basin modelling has shown that excess pore pressure generated in the North Sea Fan area is transferred to the Storegga area with reduction of the slope stability in the old escarpments in distal parts of the StoreggaSlide. The slide was most likely triggered by a strong earthquake in an area 150 km downslope from the Ormen Lange gas field and developed as a retrogressive slide. The unstable sediments in the area disappeared with the slide 8200 years ago. A new ice age with infilling of glacial sediments on top of marine clays in the slide scar would be needed to create a new unstable situation at Ormen Lange.},

   abstract = {Since the publication of "Spectral Methods in Fluid Dynamics", spectral methods, particularly in their multidomain version, have become firmly established as a mainstream tool for scientific and engineering computation. While retaining the tight integration between the theoretical and practical aspects of spectral methods that was the hallmark of the earlier book, Canuto et al. now incorporate the many improvements in the algorithms and the theory of spectral methods that have been made since 1988.The initial treatment Fundamentals in Single Domains discusses the fundamentals of the approximation of solutions to ordinary and partial differential equations on single domains by expansions in smooth, global basis functions. The first half of the book provides the algorithmic details of orthogonal expansions, transform methods, spectral discretization of differential equations plus their boundary conditions, and solution of the discretized equations by direct and iterative methods. The second half furnishes a comprehensive discussion of the mathematical theory of spectral methods on single domains, including approximation theory, stability and convergence, and illustrative applications of the theory to model boundary-value problems. Both the algorithmic and theoretical discussions cover spectral methods on tensor-product domains, triangles and tetrahedra. All chapters are enhanced with material on the Galerkin with numerical integration version of spectral methods. The discussion of direct and iterative solution methods is greatly expanded as are the set of numerical examples that illustrate the key properties of the various types of spectral approximations and the solution algorithms. A companion book "Evolution to Complex Geometries and Applications to Fluid Dynamics" contains an extensive survey of the essential algorithmic and theoretical aspects of spectral methods for complex geometries and provides detailed discussions of spectral algorithms for fluid dynamics in simple and complex geometries.},

   abstract = {This paper concerns long time interaction of envelope solitary gravity waves propagating at the surface of a two-dimensional deep fluid in potential flow. Fully nonlinear numerical simulations show how an initially long wave group slowly splits into a number of solitary wave groups. In the example presented, three large wave events are formed during the evolution. They occur during a time scale that is beyond the time range of validity of simplified equations like the nonlinear Schrödinger (NLS) equation or modifications of this equation. A Fourier analysis shows that these large wave events are caused by significant transfer to side-band modes of the carrier waves. Temporary downshiftings of the dominant wavenumber of the spectrum coincide with the formation large wave events. The wave slope at maximal amplifications is about three times higher than the initial wave slope. The results show how interacting solitary wave groups that emerge from a long wave packet can produce freak wave events. Our reference numerical simulation are performed with the fully nonlinear model of Clamond and Grue [D. Clamond, J. Grue, A fast method for fully nonlinear water wave computations, J. Fluid Mech. 447 (2001) 337–355]. The results of this model are compared with that of two weakly nonlinear models, the NLS equation and its higher-order extension derived by Trulsen et al. [K. Trulsen, I. Kliakhandler, K.B. Dysthe, M.G. Velarde, On weakly nonlinear modulation of waves on deep water, Phys. Fluids 12 (10) (2000) 2432–2437]. They are also compared with the results obtained with a high-order spectral method (HOSM) based on the formulation of West et al. [B.J. West, K.A. Brueckner, R.S. Janda, A method of studying nonlinear random field of surface gravity waves by direct numerical simulation, J. Geophys. Res. 92 (C11) (1987) 11 803–11 824]. An important issue concerning the representation and the treatment of the vertical velocity in the HOSM formulation is highlighted here for the study of long-time evolutions.},

Simulations using the nonlinear Schr odinger (NLS) equation approximately verify the stability criteria of Alber (1978) in the two-dimensional but not in the three-dimensional case. Using a modified NLS equation (Trulsen et al. 2000) the spectra relax towards a quasi-stationary state on a timescale (2ω0)1.Inthisstate the low-frequency face is steepened and the spectral peak is downshifted. The three-dimensional simulations show a power-law behaviour ω4 on the high-frequency side of the (angularly integrated) spectrum.},

Analyses of teleseismic P, SH and Rayleigh waves for finite-fault source rupture characteristics indicate ~90 s rupture duration with a low rupture velocity of ~1.5 km/s on the 10� dipping megathrust, with total slip of 2�4 m over an ~100 km long source region. The seismic moment-scaled energy release is 1.4 x 10-6, lower than 2.4 x 10-6 found for the 17 July 2006 Java tsunami earthquake (Mw 7.8). The Mentawai event ruptured up-dip of the slip region of the 12 September 2007 Kepulauan earthquake (Mw 7.9), and together with the 4 January 1907 (M 7.6) tsunami earthquake located seaward of Simeulue Island to the northwest along the arc, demonstrates the significant tsunami generation potential for shallow megathrust ruptures in regions up-dip of great underthrusting events in Indonesia and elsewhere.},

The numerical solution is obtained by a high-resolution, total variation diminishing, finite-volume numerical model, which is known to capture sharp fronts accurately. The monotone upstream scheme for conservation laws is used in conjunction with predictor-corrector time-stepping to provide a second-order accurate solution. Flux-limiting is implemented to prevent the development of spurious oscillations near discontinuities. The model also possesses the capability to track the evolution and development of an erodible bed, due to sediment entrainment and deposition. This is accomplished by solving a bed-sediment conservation equation at each time step, independent of the hydrodynamic equations, with a predictor-corrector method. The model is verified by comparison to experimental data for currents driven by uniform and nonuniform sediment.},

We discuss the issues involved in formulating diffuse-interface models for single-component and binary fluids. Recent applications and computations using these models are discussed in each case.

   abstract = {This paper presents a geometric-variational approach to continuous and discrete mechanics and field theories. Using multisymplectic geometry, we show that the existence of the fundamental geometric structures as well as their preservation along solutions can be obtained directly from the variational principle. In particular, we prove that a unique multisymplectic structure is obtained by taking the derivative of an action function, and use this structure to prove covariant generalizations of conservation of symplecticity and Noether's theorem. Natural discretization schemes for PDEs, which have these important preservation properties, then follow by choosing a discrete action functional. In the case of mechanics, we recover the variational symplectic integrators of Veselov type, while for PDEs we obtain covariant spacetime integrators which conserve the corresponding discrete multisymplectic form as well as the discrete momentum mappings corresponding to symmetries. We show that the usual notion of symplecticity along an infinite-dimensional space of fields can be naturally obtained by making a spacetime split. All of the aspects of our method are demonstrated with a nonlinear sine-Gordon equation, including computational results and a comparison with other discretization schemes.},

Since 1997, the United States has used a joint state/federal partnership to reduce tsunami hazards along US coastlines - the National Tsunami Hazard Mitigation Program. By integrating hazard assessment, warning guidance and mitigation activities, the program has created a roadmap and a set of tools to make communities more resilient to local and distant tsunamis. Among the tools are forecasting, educational programs, and design guidance for communities to become tsunami resilient.

Owing to complete integrability of the soliton equations, only pairwise soliton interactions contribute to the solution, and the evolution reduces to a transport of the eigenvalues of the associated spectral problem with the corresponding soliton velocities modified by the collisions. The proposed general procedure of the derivation of the kinetic equation is illustrated by the examples of the Korteweg-de Vries and nonlinear Schrödinger (NLS) equations.

Unlike previous models, the total buoyancy of a powder-snow avalanche was allowed to change freely via erosion from and deposition on to a static snow layer on a slope, the snow-particle entrainment rate from the slope is directly linked to the level of turbulence. A discontinuous, large-scale powder-snow avalanche occurred on 26 January 1986 near Maseguchi , Niigata Prefecture, Japan. The avalanche appears to have had a dense core at its base. The present model was employed to simulate that part of the avalanche above any dense core; the depth of the layer of fresh snow was considered to be an important parameter in the model. The model provided a resonable description of the powder-snow avalanche generated near Maseguchi, and found that the larger the depth of fresh snow, the larger the concentration of snow attained in the avalanche, and the faster its speed. In particular, the model prediction that a powder-snow avalanche strong enough to reach Maseguchi requires a depth of fresh snow of at least 2 meters was found to be in agreement with the observed depth just before the event.},

   abstract = {A general solution is presented for water waves generated by an arbitrary movement of the bed (in space and time) in a two-dimensional fluid domain with a uniform depth. The integral solution which is developed is based on a linearized approximation to the complete (nonlinear) set of governing equations. The general solution is evaluated for the specific case of a uniform upthrust or downthrow of a block section of the bed; two time-displacement histories of the bed movement are considered. An integral solution (based on a linear theory) is also developed for a three-dimensional fluid domain of uniform depth for a class of bed movements which are axially symmetric. The integral solution is evaluated for the specific case of a block upthrust or downthrow of a section of the bed, circular in planform, with a time-displacement history identical to one of the motions used in the two-dimensional model. Since the linear solutions are developed from a linearized approximation of the complete nonlinear description of wave behavior, the applicability of these solutions is investigated. Two types of nonlinear effects are found which limit the applicability of the linear theory: (1) large nonlinear effects which occur in the region of generation during the bed movement, and (2) the gradual growth of nonlinear effects during wave propagation. A model of wave behavior, which includes, in an approximate manner, both linear and nonlinear effects is presented for computing wave profiles after the linear theory has become invalid due to the growth of nonlinearities during wave propagation. An experimental program has been conducted to confirm both the linear model for the two-dimensional fluid domain and the strategy suggested for determining wave profiles during propagation after the linear theory becomes invalid. The effect of a more general time-displacement history of the moving bed than those employed in the theoretical models is also investigated experimentally. The linear theory is found to accurately approximate the wave behavior in the region of generation whenever the total displacement of the bed is much less than the water depth. Curves are developed and confirmed by the experiments which predict gross features of the lead wave propagating from the region of generation once the values of certain nondimensional parameters (which characterize the generation process) are known. For example, the maximum amplitude of the lead wave propagating from the region of generation has been found to never exceed approximately one-half of the total bed displacement. The gross features of the tsunami resulting from the Alaskan earthquake of 27 March 1964 can be estimated from the results of this study.},

   abstract = {Results of an experimental investigation of the evolution of a nonlinear wave train on deep water are reported. The initial stage of evolution is found to be characterized by exponential growth of a modulational instability, as was first discovered by Benjamin ' Feir. At later stages of evolution it is found that the instability does not lead to wave-train disintegration or loss of coherence. Instead, the modulation periodically increases and decreases, and the wave train exhibits the Fermi–Pasta–Ulam recurrence phenomenon. Results of an earlier study of nonlinear wave packets by Yuen ' Lake, in which solutions of the nonlinear Schrödinger equation were shown to provide quantitatively correct descriptions of the properties of nonlinear wave packets, are applied to describe the experimentally observed wave-train phenomena. A comparison between the laboratory data and numerical solutions of the nonlinear Schrödinger equation for the long-time evolution of nonlinear wave trains is given.},

   abstract = {The transformation of a random wave field in shallow water of variable depth is analyzed within the framework of the variable-coefficient Korteweg-de Vries equation. The characteristic wave height varies with depth according to Green's law, and this follows rigorously from the theoretical model. The skewness and kurtosis are computed, and it is shown that they increase when the depth decreases, and simultaneously the wave state deviates from the Gaussian. The probability of large-amplitude (rogue) waves increases within the transition zone. The characteristics of this process depend on the wave steepness, which is characterized in terms of the Ursell parameter. The results obtained show that the number of rogue waves may deviate significantly from the value expected for a flat bottom of a given depth. If the random wave field is represented as a soliton gas, the probabilities of soliton amplitudes increase to a high-amplitude range and the number of large-amplitude (rogue) solitons increases when the water shallows.},

The vertical structure of the currents was found to depend on flow regime. The saline and turbid hydraulic jumps showed similar characteristics. The amount of water entrained by the flows through a jump was small. The change in flow regime caused a marked reduction of the bed shear stress downstream of the jump. In nature, a turbidity current experiencing a hydraulic jump will drop most of its bedload immediately downstream from the jump, while the suspended load will respond more gradually to the change in flow regime and will deposit sediment over a distance far exceeding 1,000 times the jump height.},

The main properties of these functions and their asymptotic behaviour for large parameters are investigated. Expression of the transient leading wave travelling offshore is also derived. The distinguishing physical features of landslide tsunamis propagating in a round geometry are then pointed out and compared with those of landslide tsunamis propagating along a straight coast.

   abstract = {When a fluid which is lighter than its surroundings is emitted by a source under a sloping roof (or a heavier fluid from a source on a sloping floor), it may flow as a relatively thin turbulent layer. The motion of this layer is governed by the rate at which it entrains the ambient fluid. A theory is presented in which it is assumed that the entrainment is proportional to the velocity of the layer multiplied by an empirical function, E(Ri), of the overall Richardson number for the layer defined by Ri = g(ρa - ρ) h/ρa V2. This theory predicts that in most practical cases the layer will rapidly attain an equilibrium state in which Ri does not vary with distance downstream, and the gravitational force on the layer is just balanced by the drag due to entrainment together with friction on the floor or roof. Two series of laboratory experiments are described from which E(Ri) can be determined. In the first, the spread of a surface jet of fluid lighter than that over which it is flowing is measured; in the second, a study is made of the flow of a heavy liquid down the sloping floor of a channel. These experiments show that E falls off rapidly as Ri increases and is probably negligible when Ri is more than about 0·8. The theoretical and experimental results allow predictions to be made of flow velocities once the rate of supply of density difference is known. An estimate is also given of the uniform velocity which the ambient fluid must possess in order to cause the motion of the layer to be reversed.},

Our derivation procedure does not explicitly involve any small parameter and is straightforward. The novel system is a non-dispersive non-hydrostatic extension of the classical Saint-Venant equations. We also propose a finite volume discretization of the obtained hyperbolic system. Several test-cases are presented to highlight the added value of the new model. Some implications to tsunami wave modeling are also discussed.},

   abstract = {A high-resolution time-marching method is presented for solving the two-dimensional shallow water equations. The method uses a cell-centered formulation with collocated data rather than a space-staggered approach. Spurious oscillations are avoided by employing Monotonic Upstream Schemes for Conservation Laws (MUSCL) reconstruction with an approximate Riemann solver in a two-step Runge-Kutta time stepping scheme. A finite-volume implementation on a boundary conforming mesh is chosen to more accurately map the complex geometries that will occur in practice. These features enable the model to deal with dam break phenomena involving flow discontinuities, subcritical and supercritical flows, and other cases. The method is applied to several bore wave propagation and dam break problems. Read More: http://ascelibrary.org/doi/abs/10.1061/(ASCE)0733-9429(1998)124%3A6(605)},

The complex velocity potential is expressed in terms of known singularities and an infinite power series with unknown coefficients. Approximate solutions are obtained by truncating the power series after N terms, where N = 1, 3, 5, 7, and 9. The amplitude, a measure of the error, and several other pertinent quantities are computed for each value of N.},

@article{Rienecker1981,
   abstract = {A method for the numerical solution of steadily progressing periodic waves on irrotational flow over a horizontal bed is presented. No analytical approximations are made. A finite Fourier series, similar to Dean's stream function series, is used to give a set of nonlinear equations which can be solved using Newton's method. Application to laboratory and field situations is emphasized throughout. When compared with known results for wave speed, results from the method agree closely. Results for fluid velocities are compared with experiment and agreement found to be good, unlike results from analytical theories for high waves. The problem of shoaling waves can conveniently be studied using the present method because of its validity for all wavelengths except the solitary wave limit, using the conventional first-order approximation that on a sloping bottom the waves at any depth act as if the bed were horizontal. Wave period, energy flux and mass flux are conserved. Comparisons with experimental results show good agreement.},

   abstract = {This paper presents the recent development on the nonlinear directional wave generation process in a 3D Numerical Wave Tank (NWT). The NWT is based on a nonlinear model using the High-Order Spectral (HOS) method, which exhibits high level of accuracy as well as efficiency properties provided by a Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) solution. The wavemaker modeling appears to be a key point in the simulation and it is carefully detailed. Different levels of approximation of the wave generation (up to third-order in nonlinearity) are studied. The properties of the numerical scheme in terms of convergence, stability and accuracy are discussed. This NWT features all the characteristics of the real wave tank (directional wavemaker, absorbing zone, perfectly reflective side walls). Furthermore, several validation results and practical applications where numerical simulations are successfully compared to experiments on 2D and 3D wave fields are presented.},

   abstract = {Extreme surface waves in a deep-water long-crested sea are often interpreted as a manifestation in the real world of the so-called breathing solitons of the focusing nonlinear Schrödinger equation. While the spontaneous emergence of such coherent structures from nonlinear wave dynamics was demonstrated to take place in fiber-optics systems, the same point remains far more controversial in the hydrodynamic case. With the aim to shed further light on this matter, the emergence of breatherlike coherent wave groups in a long-crested random sea is investigated here by means of high-resolution spectral simulations of the fully nonlinear two-dimensional Euler equations. The primary focus of our study is to parametrize the structure of random wave fields with respect to the Benjamin-Feir index, which is a nondimensional measure of the energy localization in Fourier space. This choice is motivated by previous results, showing that extreme-wave activity in a long-crested sea is highly sensitive to such a parameter, which is varied here by changing both the characteristic spectral bandwidth and the average wave steepness. It is found that coherent wave groups, closely matching realizations of Kuznetsov-Ma breathers in Euler dynamics, develop within wave fields characterized by sufficiently narrow-banded spectra. The characteristic spatial and temporal scales of wave group dynamics, and the corresponding occurrence of extreme events, are quantified and discussed by means of space-time autocorrelations of the surface elevation envelope and extreme-event statistics.},

Mathematical prerequisites are relatively modest (mainly linear algebra at the undergraduate level) especially for the first half of the book. Topics are carefully developed and motivated with many examples, and there are over 500 exercises to test the reader's understanding. The last chapter contains a survey of more advanced topics, and a comprehensive bibliography is included.

@article{Rowley2005,
   abstract = {Many of the tools of dynamical systems and control theory have gone largely unused for fluids, because the governing equations are so dynamically complex, both high-dimensional and nonlinear. Model reduction involves finding low-dimensional models that approximate the full high-dimensional dynamics. This paper compares three different methods of model reduction: proper orthogonal decomposition (POD), balanced truncation, and a method called balanced POD. Balanced truncation produces better reduced-order models than POD, but is not computationally tractable for very large systems. Balanced POD is a tractable method for computing approximate balanced truncations, that has computational cost similar to that of POD. The method presented here is a variation of existing methods using empirical Gramians, and the main contributions of the present paper are a version of the method of snapshots that allows one to compute balancing transformations directly, without separate reduction of the Gramians; and an output projection method, which allows tractable computation even when the number of outputs is large. The output projection method requires minimal additional computation, and has a priori error bounds that can guide the choice of rank of the projection. Connections between POD and balanced truncation are also illuminated: in particular, balanced truncation may be viewed as POD of a particular dataset, using the observability Gramian as an inner product. The three methods are illustrated on a numerical example, the linearized flow in a plane channel. Read More: http://www.worldscientific.com/doi/abs/10.1142/S0218127405012429?journalCode=ijbc},

The spectrum of spatial amplitudes at the breaking time $t = t_b$ has an asymptotic decay of $k^\{-4/3\}$, with corresponding energy spectrum decaying as $k^\{-8/3\}$. This spectrum is formed by the singularity of the form $(x-x_b)^\{1/3\}$ in the wave shape at the breaking time. This result remains valid for arbitrary nonlinear wave speed. In addition, we demonstrate numerically that the universal power law is observed for long time in the range of small wave numbers if small dissipation or dispersion is accounted in the viscous Burgers or Korteweg-de Vries equations.},

Concentrating on applications arising from fluid dynamics, Vanden-Broeck draws upon his years of experience in the field to address the many challenges involved in attempting to describe such flows mathematically. Whilst careful numerical techniques are implemented to solve the basic equations, an emphasis is placed upon the reader developing a deep understanding of the structure of the resulting solutions. The author also reviews relevant concepts in fluid mechanics to help readers from other scientific fields who are interested in free boundary problems.},

The new evolution equations are also solved numerically using a pseudo-spectral method to study the Benjamin-Feir instability of a modulated wave train in both positive and negative shear currents. With a fixed wave slope, compared with the irrotational case, the envelope of the modulated wave train grows faster in a positive shear current and slower in a negative shear current.},

From linear wave theory, we know that the wave amplitude on a vertical wall is twice the incident wave amplitude with weakly nonlinear theories bringing small corrections to this result. In this present study, however, we show that certain simple wave groups may produce much higher runups than previously predicted, with particular incident wave frequencies resulting in runup heights exceeding the initial wave amplitude by a factor of 5, suggesting that the notion of the design wave used in coastal structure design may need to be revisited. The results presented in this study can be considered as a note of caution for practitioners, on one side, and as a challenging novel material for theoreticians who work in the field of extreme wave-coastal structure interaction.},

During recent laboratory tests in a wave tank, peaks in the hydrodynamic actions on the converter occurred at certain frequencies of the incident waves. This resonant mechanism is known to be generated by the transverse sloshing modes of the channel. Here the influence of the channel sloshing modes on the performance of the device is further investigated. Within the framework of a linear inviscid potential-flow theory, application of Green’s theorem yields a hypersingular integral equation for the velocity potential in the fluid domain. The solution is found in terms of a fast-converging series of Chebyshev polynomials of the second kind. The physical behaviour of the system is then analysed, showing sensitivity of the resonant sloshing modes to the geometry of the device, which concurs in increasing the maximum efficiency. Analytical results are validated with available numerical and experimental data.},

Of particular interest, the wave characteristics at sharp-bends is rationalized by using the Jacobian of the Schwarz-Christoffel transformation. It is observed that it acts in a similar fashion as a topography in other wave models previously studied. Previous numerical studies are revisited. A new very efficient algorithm is described, which computationally solves the problem in much more general channel configurations than presented in the literature. Also the conformal mapping naturally leads to a new strategy regarding the geometrical singularity at the sharp-bends. Finally preliminary results illustrate the use of the mapping's Jacobian at a channel's branching point. A future goal of this study regards deducing accurate reduced (one-dimensional) models for the reflection and transmission of solitary waves on graphs/networks.},

   abstract = {The steady, gravity-driven flow of a liquid film over a topographically structured substrate is investigated. The analysis is based on a model nonlinear equation for the film thickness derived on the basis of long-wave asymptotics. The free-surface shape is expanded in a regular asymptotic expansion in powers of the topography amplitude, and solutions are obtained up to second order. Solutions are constructed for downward steps, upward steps, and rectangular trenches, and the results are compared favorably with numerical solutions of the nonlinear model equation. The results indicate that all of the salient features previously found for film flows over steps and into trenches are captured by the small-step asymptotics, including the capillary ridge formed just above a downward step and oscillations upstream of an upward step. We derive analytical expressions for the period and amplitude of these oscillations. The effect of a normal electric on the film surface shape is also investigated on the assumption that both the film and the medium above the film behave as perfect dielectrics. Again, the small-amplitude asymptotics describe the essential characteristics of the free surface, including oscillations downstream of a downwards step with a quantifiable period and amplitude. It is established analytically and numerically that the amplitude of interfacial oscillations just upstream of a step decreases with an increase of the electric field strength in the case of perfect conductors, but increases to a limiting value for perfect dielectrics. It is found that nonlinear solutions are in excellent agreement with the small-amplitude theory even for relatively large topography amplitudes},

The flat plate is held at constant voltage, and a vertical electric field is generated by a second parallel electrode kept at a different constant voltage and placed at a large vertical distance from the bottom plate. The fluid is viscous, and gravity and surface tension act. The equation is derived using lubrication theory and contains an additional nonlinear nonlocal term representing the electric field. The electric field is linearly destabilizing and is particularly important in producing nontrivial dynamics in the case when the film rests on the upper side of the plate. We give rigorous results on the global boundedness of positive periodic smooth solutions, using an appropriate energy functional. We also implement a fully implicit numerical scheme and perform extensive numerical experiments. Through a combination of analysis and numerical experiments we present evidence for the global existence of positive smooth solutions. This means, in turn, that the film does not touch the wall in finite time but asymptotically at infinite time. Numerical solutions are presented to support such phenomena, which are also observed in hanging films when electric fields are absent.},

   abstract = {The propagation of long wavelength disturbances on the surface of a fluid layer of finite depth is considered. Attention is focused on the effect of stress applied at the surface. Constant surface tension leads to a normal stress at the surface, but the presence of a surfactant or the application of an electric field can give rise to tangential stresses. In the large Reynolds number limit, the evolution equation for the surface elevation contains contributions from both boundary layers in the flow; one is adjacent to the free surface while the other lies at the base of the fluid layer.Aweakly non-linear analysis is performed leading to an evolution equation similar to the classic Korteweg-de Vries equation, but modified by additional terms due to the viscosity and to the tangential and normal stress at the surface. It is demonstrated that careful treatment of the boundary layer at the free surface is necessary when the tangential stress at the surface is non-zero. Particular cases of flows with tangential surface stress due the presence of a surfactant or due to an electric field are discussed, and a pseudo-spectral scheme is used in order to obtain some typical numerical results.},

   abstract = {Studying the transition from a linearly stable coherent laminar state to a highly disordered state of turbulence is conceptually and technically challenging, and of great interest because all pipe and channel flows are of that type. In optics, understanding how a system loses coherence, as spatial size or the strength of excitation increases, is a fundamental problem of practical importance. Here, we report our studies of a fibre laser that operates in both laminar and turbulent regimes. We show that the laminar phase is analogous to a one-dimensional coherent condensate and the onset of turbulence is due to the loss of spatial coherence. Our investigations suggest that the laminar–turbulent transition in the laser is due to condensate destruction by clustering dark and grey solitons. This finding could prove valuable for the design of coherent optical devices as well as systems operating far from thermodynamic equilibrium.},

Since its derivation requires no assumption on wave amplitude, the model can be used to describe arbitrary amplitude waves. It is shown that the simple model captures the interesting features of strongly nonlinear solitary waves observed in previous numerical solutions. When compared with the case of zero vorticity, the solitary wave in uniform shear flows is wider when propagating upstream (opposite to the direction of surface drift), while it is narrower when propagating downstream. For the upstream-propagating solitary wave, a stationary recirculating eddy appears at the bottom when wave amplitude exceeds the critical value. For the case of downstream propagation, no eddy forms at the bottom but the solitary wave becomes more peaked, yielding a cusp at the critical wave amplitude, beyond which the solitary wave has a round wave profile. Although the appearance of the derivative singularity is inconsistent with the long-wave assumption in the model, round wave profiles away from the singularity are qualitatively similar to numerical solutions and observation.},

Our main result is the construction of the selected front and a rigorous asymptotic approximation of its propagation speed, valid to second order. We use techniques from geometric singular perturbation theory and geometric desingularization. The main challenge arises from the slow passage through a saddle-node bifurcation. From a perspective of linear versus nonlinear speed selection, this front provides an interesting example as the propagation speed is slower than the linear spreading speed. However, our front shares many characteristics with pushed fronts that arise when the influence of nonlinearity leads to faster than linear speeds of propagation. We show that this is a result of the linear spreading speed arising as a simple pole of the resolvent instead of as a branch pole. Using the pointwise Green's function, we show that this pole poses no a priori obstacle to marginal stability of the nonlinear travelling front, thus explaining how nonlinear systems can exhibit slower spreading that their linearization in a robust fashion.},

In such systems, a resonance between a solitary wave of one of the two equations and a co-propagating periodic wave of the other equation can occur. The resulting wave is a generalized solitary wave, with non-vanishing oscillatory tails. It is shown that in the case of a ‘table-top’ solitary wave, which is solution to an extended Korteweg-de Vries equation with a cubic nonlinearity, the generalized solitary waves do not behave like standard sech2 generalized solitary waves. In particular, it is shown that the oscillations can vanish in the tails or in the central core, but not in both simultaneously. A simplified model is introduced, which allows a better understanding of these stationary long wave solutions and the occurrence of embedded solitons.},

A region of Bond number-Froude number parameter space close to ($\frac\{1\}\{3\}$, 1) is identified, at each point of which there are infinitely many distinct multi-troughed solitary waves of depression. The method is to study a Hamiltonian formulation of the mathematical problem for solitary waves using a centre-manifold technique valid near Bond number $\frac\{1\}\{3\}$ and Froude number 1. The problem is thus replaced by an equivalent problem posed on a four-dimensional manifold. In a certain region of parameter space near ($\frac\{1\}\{3\}$, 1), there is a Smale horseshoe in the dynamics on the centre manifold and therefore infinitely many distinct homoclinic orbits.},

   abstract = {The model equation arises as the equation for solitary-wave solutions to a fifth-order long-wave equation for gravity-capillary water waves. Being Hamiltonian, reversible and depending upon two parameters, it shares the structure of the full steady water-wave problem. Moreover, all known analytical results for local bifurcations of solitary-wave solutions to the full water-wave problem have precise counterparts for the model equation. At the time of writing two major open problems for steady water waves are attracting particular attention. The first concerns the possible existence of solitary waves of elevation as local bifurcation phenomena in a particular parameter regime; the second, larger, issue is the determination of the global bifurcation picture for solitary waves. Given that the above equation is a good model for solitary waves of depression, it seems natural to study the above issues for this equation; they are comprehensively treated in this article. The equation is found to have branches of solitary waves of elevation bifurcating from the trivial solution in the appropriate parameter regime, one of which is described by an explicit solution. Numerical and analytical investigations reveal a rich global bifurcation picture including multi-modal solitary waves of elevation and depression together with interactions between the two types of wave. There are also new orbit-flip bifurcations and associated multi-crested solitary waves with non-oscillatory tails.},

Bundle adjustment involves the formulation of a large scale, yet sparse minimization problem, which is traditionally solved using a sparse variant of the Levenberg-Marquardt optimization algorithm that avoids storing and operating on zero entries. This paper argues that considerable computational benefits can be gained by substituting the sparse Levenberg-Marquardt algorithm in the implementation of bundle adjustment with a sparse variant of Powell's dog leg non-linear least squares technique.

In the model of nonlinear Schrödinger equation we will introduce a transformation to displaced phase-amplitude variables with respect to a background of monochromatic waves. The potential energy in the Hamiltonian then depends essentially on the phase. Looking as a special case to phases that are time independent, the oscillator equation for the signal at each position becomes autonomous, with the change of phase with position as only driving force for a spatial evolution towards extreme waves. This is observed to be the governing process of wave amplification in classes of already known solutions of NLS, namely the Akhmediev-, Ma- and Peregrine-solitons. We investigate the case of the soliton on finite background in detail in this Letter as the solution that descibes the complete spatial evolution of modulational instability from background to extreme waves.},

The fully-discrete scheme utilizes the Galerkin / finite-element method based on smooth periodic splines in space, and an explicit fourth-order Runge–Kutta method in time. Computations compared with exact solitary and cnoidal wave solutions show that the scheme achieves the optimal orders of accuracy in space and time. These computations also show that the stability of this scheme does not impose very restrictive conditions on the temporal stepsize. In addition, solitary, cnoidal, and dispersive shock waves are studied in detail using this numerical scheme for the Serre system and compared with the ‘classical’ Boussinesq system for small-amplitude shallow water waves. The results show that the interaction of solitary waves in the Serre system is more inelastic. The efficacy of the numerical scheme for modeling dispersive shocks is shown by comparison with asymptotic results. These results have application to the modeling of shallow water waves of intermediate or large amplitude.},

   abstract = {The Korteweg-de Vries equation, which describes the unidirectional propagation of long waves in a wide class of nonlinear dispersive systems, is well known to have solutions representing solitary waves. The present analysis establishes that these solutions are stable, confirming a property that has for a long time been presumed. The demonstration of stability hinges on two nonlinear functionals which for solutions of the Korteweg-de Vries equation are invariant with time: these are introduced in section 2, where it is recalled that Boussinesq recognized their significance in relation to the stability of solitary waves. The principles upon which the stability theory is based are explained in section 3, being supported by a few elementary ideas from functional analysis. A proof that solitary wave solutions are stable is completed in section 4, the most exacting steps of which are accomplished by means of spectral theory. In appendix A a method deriving from the calculus of variations is presented, whereby results needed for the proof of stability may be obtained independently of spectral theory as used in section 4. In appendix B it is shown how the stability analysis may readily be adapted to solitary-wave solutions of the 'regularized long-wave equation' that has recently been advocated by Benjamin, Bona & Mahony as an alternative to the Korteweg-de Vries equation. In appendix C a variational principle is demonstrated relating to the exact boundary-value problem for solitary waves in water: this is a counterpart to a principle used in the present work (introduced in section 2) and offers some prospect of proving the stability of exact solitary waves.},

   abstract = {The propagation of pulses in ideal nonlinear optical fibers without loss is governed by the nonlinear Schrödinger equation (NLS). When considering realistic fibers one must examine perturbed NLS equations, with the particular perturbation depending on the physical situation that is being modeled. A common example is the complex Ginzburg-Landau equation (CGL), which is a dissipative perturbation. It is known that some of the stable bright solitons of the NLS survive a dissipative perturbation such as the CGL. Given that a wave persists, it is then important to determine its stability with respect to the perturbed NLS. A major difficulty in analyzing the stability of solitary waves upon adding dissipative terms is that eigenvalues may bifurcate out of the essential spectrum. Since the essential spectrum of the NLS is located on the imaginary axis, such eigenvalues may lead to an unstable wave. In fact, eigenvalues can pop out of the essential spectrum even if the unperturbed problem has no eigenvalue embedded in the essential spectrum. Here we present a technique which can be used to track these bifurcating eigenvalues. As a consequence, we are able to locate the spectrum for bright solitary-wave solutions to various perturbed nonlinear Schrödinger equations, and determine precise conditions on parameters for which the waves are stable. In addition, we show that a particular perturbation, the parametrically forced NLS equation, supports stable multi-bump solitary waves. The technique for tracking eigenvalues which bifurcate from the essential spectrum is very general and should therefore be applicable to a larger class of problems than those presented here.},

Two canonical cases are considered. In one case, two counterpropagating dispersive shock waves experience a head-on collision, interact and eventually exit the interaction region with larger amplitudes and altered speeds. In the other case, a fast dispersive shock overtakes a slower one, giving rise to an interaction. Eventually the two merge into a single dispersive shock wave. In both cases, the interaction region is described by a modulated, quasi-periodic two-phase solution of the nonlinear Schrödinger equation. The boundaries between the background density, dispersive shock waves and their interaction region are calculated by solving the Whitham modulation equations. These asymptotic results are in excellent agreement with full numerical simulations. It is further shown that the interactions of two dispersive shock waves have some qualitative similarities to the interactions of two classical shock waves.},

In previous work it was shown by rigorous Evans function calculations that the formal slow modulation approximation resulting in the linearized Whitham averaged system accurately describes the spectral stability to long-wavelength perturbations. To clarify the connection between Bloch-wave-based expansions and Evans-function-based approaches, we reproduce this result without reference to the Evans function by using direct Bloch expansion methods and spectral perturbation analysis. One of the novelties of this approach is that we are able to calculate the relevant Bloch waves explicitly for arbitrary finite-amplitude solutions. Furthermore, this approach has the advantage of being applicable in the more general multi-periodic setting where no conveniently computable Evans function has yet been devised.},

   abstract = {The dynamics of wave groups is studied for long waves, using the framework of the extended Korteweg-de Vries equation. It is shown that the dynamics is much richer than the corresponding results obtained just from the Korteweg-de Vries equation. First, a reduction to a nonlinear Schrödinger equation is obtained for weakly nonlinear wave packets, and it is demonstrated that either the focussing or the defocussing case can be obtained. This is in contrast to the corresponding reduction for the Korteweg-de Vries equation, where only the defocussing case is obtained. Next, the condition for modulational instability is obtained. It is shown that wave packets are unstable only for a positive sign of the coefficient of the cubic nonlinear term in the extended Korteweg-de Vries equation, and for a high carrier frequency. At the boundary of this parameter space, a modified nonlinear Schrödinger equation is derived, and its steady-state solutions, including an algebraic soliton, are found. The exact breather solution of the extended Korteweg-de Vries equation is analysed. It is shown that in the limit of weak nonlinearity it transforms to a wave group with an envelope described by soliton solutions of the nonlinear Schrödinger equation and its modification as described above. Numerical simulations demonstrate the main features of wave group evolution and show some differences in the behaviour of the solutions of the extended Korteweg-de Vries equation, compared with those of the nonlinear Schrödinger equation.},

Specifically, we extend the work of Bronski and Johnson by demonstrating that the homogenized system describing the mean behavior of a slow modulation (WKB) approximation of the solution correctly describes the linearized dispersion relation near zero frequency of the linearized equations about the background periodic wave. The latter has been shown by rigorous Evans function techniques to control the spectral stability near the origin, that is, stability to slow modulations of the underlying solution. In particular, through our derivation of the WKB approximation we generalize the modulation expansion of Whitham for the KdV to a more general class of equations which admit periodic waves with nonzero mean. As a consequence, we will show that, assuming a particular nondegeneracy condition, spectral stability near the origin is equivalent with the local well-posedness of the Whitham system.},

In this letter we give an overview of these structures and their properties and a list of criteria about which model of energy cascade should be used in the analysis of a given experiment, using water waves as an example. Applying the time scale analysis to weakly nonlinear wave systems modeled by the focusing nonlinear Schödinger equation, we demonstrate that K-cascade and D-cascade are not competing processes but rather two processes taking place at different time scales, at different characteristic levels of nonlinearity and based on different physical mechanisms. Applying those criteria to data known from experiments with surface water waves we find that the energy cascades observed occur at short characteristic times compatible only with a D-cascade. The only pre-requisite for a D-cascade being a focusing nonlinear Schödinger equation, the same analysis may be applied to existing experiments with wave systems appearing in hydrodynamics, nonlinear optics, electrodynamics, plasma, convection theory, etc.},

   abstract = {In this paper, we investigate the performance of pseudo-spectral methods in computing nearly singular solutions of fluid dynamics equations. We consider two different ways of removing the aliasing errors in a pseudo-spectral method. The first one is the traditional 2/3 dealiasing rule. The second one is a high (36th) order Fourier smoothing which keeps a significant portion of the Fourier modes beyond the 2/3 cut-off point in the Fourier spectrum for the 2/3 dealiasing method. Both the 1D Burgers equation and the 3D incompressible Euler equations are considered. We demonstrate that the pseudo-spectral method with the high order Fourier smoothing gives a much better performance than the pseudo-spectral method with the 2/3 dealiasing rule. Moreover, we show that the high order Fourier smoothing method captures about 12–15% more effective Fourier modes in each dimension than the 2/3 dealiasing method. For the 3D Euler equations, the gain in the effective Fourier codes for the high order Fourier smoothing method can be as large as 20% over the 2/3 dealiasing method. Another interesting observation is that the error produced by the high order Fourier smoothing method is highly localized near the region where the solution is most singular, while the 2/3 dealiasing method tends to produce oscillations in the entire domain. The high order Fourier smoothing method is also found be very stable dynamically. No high frequency instability has been observed. In the case of the 3D Euler equations, the energy is conserved up to at least six digits of accuracy throughout the computations.},

Finally, it is shown how more general dispersive relations can be formulated by means of integro-differential equations; an important application of this, developed with some success, is towards resolving longstanding difficulties in understanding the breaking of water waves.},

The aim of the work is to validate the hypotheses underlying the statistical theory of nonlinear dispersive waves and to clarify the role of exactly resonant, nearly resonant and non-resonant wave interactions. These basic questions are addressed by examining relatively simple wave systems consisting of a finite number of wave packets localized in Fourier space. For simulation of the long-term evolution of random water wave fields we employ an efficient DNS approach based on the integrodifferential Zakharov equation. The non-resonant cubic terms in the Hamiltonian are excluded by the canonical transformation. The proposed approach does not use a regular grid of harmonics in Fourier space. Instead, wave packets are represented by clusters of discrete Fourier harmonics.},

The critical wavenumber for which the carrier is marginally modulationally unstable is determined by the condition that the product of the coefficients of the non-linear and dispersive terms in the NS equation is zero. However, near this marginal state the assumptions that lead to the NS equation are invalid and a modified form of the NS equation that involves higher-order non-linearities is appropriate. This modified NS equation is here derived formally for a general system involving a single dependent variable and a revised form of the instability criterion is obtained. The results are illustrated by considering a particular system described by a generalised Korteweg-de Vries equation.},

After a brief overview of particle physics and a survey of relativistic wave equations and Lagrangian methods, the author develops the quantum theory of scalar and spinor fields, and then of gauge fields. The emphasis throughout is on functional methods, which have played a large part in modern field theory. The book concludes with a brief survey of "topological" objects in field theory and, new to this edition, a chapter devoted to supersymmetry. Graduate students in particle physics and high energy physics will benefit from this book.},

The bore is undular if the change in surface elevation of the wave is less than 0.28 of the original depth of water. This paper describes the growth of an undular bore from a long wave which forms a gentle transition between a uniform flow and still water. A physical account of its development is followed by the results of numerical calculations. These use finite-difference approximations to the partial differential equations of motion. The equations of motion are of the same order of approximation as is necessary to derive the solitary wave. The results are in general agreement with the available experimental measurements.},

Reading this book will give the reader a deep understanding of the interrelationships between the three basic theories of physics. The first tow chapters provide the necessary mathematical background in differential geometry, Lie groups, and symplectic geometry. In Chapter 3 a coherent symplectic description of Galilean and relativistic mechanics is given, culminating in the classification of elementary particles (relativistic and non-relativistic, with or without spin, with or without mass). In Chapter 4 statistical mechanics is put into symplectic form, finishing with a symplectic description of the kinetic theory of gases and the computation of specific heats. Finally, in Chapter 5 the author presents his theory of geometric quantization. Highlights of this chapter are the derivations of various wave equations and the construction of the Fock space.},

   abstract = {Finite-dimensional wave turbulence refers to the chaotic dynamics of interacting wave ''clusters'' consisting of finite number of connected wave triads with exact three-wave resonances. We examine this phenomenon using the example of atmospheric planetary (Rossby) waves. It is shown that the dynamics of the clusters is determined by the types of connections between neighboring triads within a cluster; these correspond to substantially different scenarios of energy flux between different triads. All the possible cases of the energy cascade termination are classified. Free and forced chaotic dynamics in the clusters are investigated: due to the huge fluctuations of the energy exchange between resonant triads these two types of evolution have a lot in common. It is confirmed that finite-dimensional wave turbulence in finite wave systems is fundamentally different from kinetic wave turbulence in infinite systems; the latter is described by wave-kinetic equations that account for interactions with overlapping quasiresonances of finite amplitude waves. The present results are directly applicable to finite-dimensional wave turbulence in any wave system in finite domains with three-mode interactions as encountered in hydrodynamics, astronomy, plasma physics, chemistry, medicine, etc.},

Analysis is carried out up to the third order in wave steepness. The apparent, Eulerian and Lagrangian accelerations are computed for wave parameters observed in experiments. It is demonstrated that for a wave group with a wide spectrum, the crest propagation velocity differs significantly from both the phase and the group velocities of the peak wave.

   abstract = {The extended Korteweg-de Vries equation which includes nonlinear and dispersive terms cubic in the wave amplitude is derived from the water-wave equations and the Lagrangian for the water-wave equations. For the special case in which only the higher-order nonlinear term is retained, the extended Korteweg-de Vries equation is transformed into the Korteweg-de Vries equation. Modulation equations for this equation are then derived from the modulation equations for the Korteweg-de Vries equation and the undular bore solution of the extended Korteweg-de Vries equation is found as a simple wave solution of these modulation equations. The modulation equations are also used to extend the solution for the resonant flow of a fluid over topography. This resonant flow occurs when, in the weakly nonlinear, long-wave limit, the basic flow speed is close to a linear long-wave phase speed for one of the long-wave modes. In addition to the effect of higher-order terms, the effect of boundary-layer viscosity is also considered. These solutions (with and without viscosity) are compared with recent experimental and numerical results.},

We formulate and prove a new theorem on integrability which allows us to show that most frequently met clusters are described by integrable dynamical systems. We argue that construction of clusters can be used as the base for the Clipping method, substantially more effective for these systems than the Galerkin method.

We focus on the set of wave modes which can interact quasi-resonantly at a particular level of resonance broadening and aim to characterize how the structure of this set changes as the level of resonance broadening is varied. The commonly held view that resonance broadening can be thought of as a thickening of the resonant manifold is misleading. We show that in fact the set of modes corresponding to a single quasi-resonant triad has a non-trivial structure and that its area in fact diverges for a finite degree of broadening. We also study the connectivity of the network of modes which is generated when quasi-resonant triads share common modes. This network has been argued to form the backbone for energy transfer in Rossby wave turbulence. We show that this network undergoes a percolation transition when the level of resonance broadening exceeds a critical value. Below this critical value, the largest connected component of the quasi-resonant network contains a negligible fraction of the total number of modes in the system whereas above this critical value a finite fraction of the total number of modes in the system are contained in the largest connected component. We argue that this percolation transition should correspond to the transition to turbulence in the system.},

The analysis applies to both constant cross-section and periodic waveguides as well. Unlike previous studies, the analysis enables the estimation of the frequency dependence of the coupling coefficients. It is also confirmed that the waveguide-cavity coupling causes a detuning of the resonant frequency of the cavity mode. The detuning is estimated in the case of a photonic crystal waveguide-cavity system and it is shown that it can be significant especially if the structure is intended for filtering applications. The analysis is generalized to the case of a multimode or multiple cavities and provides a useful tool in the analysis of devices based on coupled cavities.},

This review presents the benefits and drawbacks in terms of accuracy, robustness, computational efficiency, and conservation properties. The WD algorithms also tend to be highly tailored to the numerical model they serve and therefore difficult to generalize. Furthermore, the lack of temporally and spatially defined validation data has hampered comparisons of the models in terms of their ability to simulate WD over real domains.

   abstract = {Hydraulic model tests and numerical simulations show that long sinusoidal waves that are generated in very shallow waters are not stable but show modifications of the free surface as function of propagation in time and space. First, with increasing distance from the wave maker the wave becomes asymmetric and develops into a bore-shaped wave. Second, with further increasing distance more and more additional wave crests appear from the front of the bore (undular bore). The shallower the water depth, the more additional wave components can be observed. In extremely shallow water, the periodic sine waves completely disintegrate into periodic trains of solitons. At Leichtweiss-Institute for Hydraulic Engineering and Water Resources (LWI), TU Braunschweig, a nonlinear Fourier transform based on the Korteweg-deVries equation (KdV-NLFT) is implemented and successfully applied in Brühl [1] that provides an explanation for this nonlinear phenomenon and allows the prediction of the dispersion and propagation of long sinusoidal waves in shallow water.},

The slight modification is related to the effect of the time-averaged current on the seaward boundary condition and improves the agreement between the computed and measured mean water levels on gentle slopes. The modified numerical model is compared with available small-scale test data for monochromatic waves spilling on gentle slopes as well as for monochromatic waves plunging and surging on a relatively steep slope. Additional comparisons are made with small-scale tests conducted using transient monochromatic and grouped waves on a 1:8 smooth slope with and without an idealized nearshore bar at the toe of the 1:8 slope. As a whole, the numerical model is shown to be capable of predicting both time-varying and time-averaged hydrodynamic quantities in the surf and swash zones on gentle as well as steep slopes.},

   abstract = {We analyze the 1D focusing nonlinear Schrödinger equation in a finite interval with homogeneous Dirichlet or Neumann boundary conditions. There are two main dynamics, the collapse which is very fast and a slow cascade of Fourier modes. For the cubic nonlinearity the calculations show no long-term energy exchange between Fourier modes as opposed to higher nonlinearities. This slow dynamics is explained by fairly simple amplitude equations for the resonant Fourier modes. Their solutions are well behaved so filtering high frequencies prevents collapse. Finally, these equations elucidate the unique role of the zero mode for the Neumann boundary conditions.},

   abstract = {In this work we consider finite volume schemes combined with dynamic spatial mesh redistribution. We study whether appropriate mesh redistribution is a satisfactory mechanism for increasing the resolution of numerical solutions for problems of scalar and systems of conservation laws (CL) in one space dimension, while being at the same time a stabilization mechanism for selecting the appropriate entropy solution. In order to increase the resolution around shock areas and keep the computational cost low, our redistribution policy is to reconstruct spatially the numerical solution on a new mesh, where the solution’s curvature is almost uniformly distributed, while the node’s cardinality is kept constant. We examine the stabilization properties of that redistribution process by adding it as a substep on the time evolution step of some classical schemes with known (unstable) characteristics. Testing the resulting method for several such schemes and on a large number of CL problems that have solutions with special characteristics (shocks, rarefaction areas, steady states) and comparing the results with those produced by schemes with extra stabilization mechanisms (like slope/flux limiters, entropy corrections), we conclude that indeed the proposed redistribution adds such stabilization properties while at the same time increasing the resolution.},

   abstract = {The finite-element spatial discretization of the linear shallow-water equations on unstructured triangular meshes is examined in the context of a semi-implicit temporal discretization. Triangular finite elements are attractive for ocean modeling because of their flexibility for representing irregular boundaries and for local mesh refinement. The semi-implicit scheme is beneficial because it slows the propagation of the high-frequency small-amplitude surface gravity waves, thereby circumventing a severe time step restriction. High-order computationally expensive finite elements are, however, of little benefit for the discretization of the terms responsible for rapidly propagating gravity waves in a semi-implicit formulation. Low-order velocity/surface-elevation finite-element combinations are therefore examined here. Ideally, the finite-element basis-function pair should adequately represent approximate geostrophic balance, avoid generating spurious computational modes, and give a consistent discretization of the governing equations. Existing finite-element combinations fail to simultaneously satisfy all of these requirements and consequently suffer to a greater or lesser extent from noise problems. An unconventional and largely unknown finite-element pair, based on a modified combination of linear and constant basis functions, is shown to be a good compromise and to give good results for gravity-wave propagation.},

   abstract = {For most of the discretization schemes, the numerical approximation of shallow-water models is a delicate problem. Indeed, the coupling between the momentum and the continuity equations usually leads to the appearance of spurious solutions and to anomalous dissipation/dispersion in the representation of the fast (Poincaré) and slow (Rossby) waves. In order to understand these difficulties and to select appropriate spatial discretization schemes, Fourier/dispersion analyses and the study of the null space of the associated discretized problems have proven beneficial. However, the cause of spurious oscillations and reduced convergence rates, that have been detected for most of mixed-order finite element shallow-water formulations, in simulating classical problems of geophysical fluid dynamics, is still an open question. The aim of the present study is to show that when spurious inertial solutions are present, they are mainly responsible for the aforementioned problems. Further, a criterion is found which determines the existence and the number of spurious inertial solutions. As it is delicate to cure spurious inertial modes, a class of possible discretization schemes is proposed, that is not affected by such spurious solutions.},

Firstly, we give a basic grounding in the fundamentals of SPH, showing how the equations of motion and energy can be self-consistently derived from the density estimate. We then show how to interpret these equations using the basic SPH interpolation formulae and highlight the subtle difference in approach between SPH and other particle methods. In doing so, we also critique several 'urban myths' regarding SPH, in particular the idea that one can simply increase the 'neighbour number' more slowly than the total number of particles in order to obtain convergence. We also discuss the origin of numerical instabilities such as the pairing and tensile instabilities. Finally, we give practical advice on how to resolve three of the main issues with SPMHD: removing the tensile instability, formulating dissipative terms for MHD shocks and enforcing the divergence constraint on the particles, and we give the current status of developments in this area. Accompanying the paper is the first public release of the ndspmhd SPH code, a 1, 2 and 3 dimensional code designed as a testbed for SPH/SPMHD algorithms that can be used to test many of the ideas and used to run all of the numerical examples contained in the paper. ?? 2010 Elsevier Inc..},

   abstract = {We present the design and operation of a flow apparatus for investigations of mixing in time-periodic and spatially periodic chaotic flows. Uses are illustrated in terms of two devices operating in the Stokes regime: the partitioned-pipe mixer, a spatially periodic system consisting of sequences of flows in semicircular ducts, and the eccentric helical annular mixer, a time-periodic velocity field between eccentric cylinders with a superposed Poiseuille flow; other mixing flows can be implemented with relative ease. Fundamental differences between spatially periodic and time-periodic duct flows are readily apparent. Steady spatially periodic systems show segregated KAM-tubes coexisting with chaotic advection; such tubes are remarkably stable under a variety of experimental conditions. Time-periodic duct flows lead to complex streakline structures; since regular regions in the cross-sectional flow move through space, a streakline can find itself injected in a regular domain for some time then be trapped in a chaotic region, and so on, leading to ‘intermittent’ behaviour.},

   abstract = {Highly supersonic, compressible turbulence is thought to be of tantamount importance for star formation processes in the interstellar medium (ISM). Likewise, cosmic structure formation is expected to give rise to subsonic turbulence in the intergalactic medium (IGM), which may substantially modify the thermodynamic structure of gas in virialized dark matter halos and affect small-scale mixing processes in the gas. Numerical simulations have played a key role in characterizing the properties of astrophysical turbulence, but thus far systematic code comparisons have been restricted to the supersonic regime, leaving it unclear whether subsonic turbulence is faithfully represented by the numerical techniques commonly employed in astrophysics. Here we focus on comparing the accuracy of smoothed particle hydrodynamics (SPH) and our new moving-mesh technique AREPO in simulations of driven subsonic turbulence. To make contact with previous results, we also analyze simulations of transsonic and highly supersonic turbulence. We find that the widely employed standard formulation of SPH quite badly fails in the subsonic regime. Instead of building up a Kolmogorov-like turbulent cascade, large-scale eddies are quickly damped close to the driving scale and decay into small-scale velocity noise. In contrast, our moving-mesh technique does yield power-law scaling laws for the power spectra of velocity, vorticity and density, consistent with expectations for fully developed isotropic turbulence. This casts doubt about the reliability of SPH for simulations of cosmic structure formation, especially if turbulence in clusters of galaxies is indeed significant. In contrast, SPH's performance is much better for supersonic turbulence, as here the flow is kinetically dominated and characterized by a network of strong shocks, which can be adequately captured with SPH.

   abstract = {Accounting for the Reynolds number is critical in numerical simulations of turbulence, particularly for subsonic flow. For smoothed particle hydrodynamics (SPH) with constant artificial viscosity coefficient α, it is shown that the effective Reynolds number in the absence of explicit physical viscosity terms scales linearly with the Mach number – compared to mesh schemes, where the effective Reynolds number is largely independent of the flow velocity. As a result, SPH simulations with α = 1 will have low Reynolds numbers in the subsonic regime compared to mesh codes, which may be insufficient to resolve turbulent flow. This explains the failure of Bauer & Springel to find agreement between the moving-mesh code arepo and the gadget SPH code on simulations of driven, subsonic (v∼ 0.3cs) turbulence appropriate to the intergalactic/intracluster medium, where it was alleged that SPH is somehow fundamentally incapable of producing a Kolmogorov-like turbulent cascade. We show that turbulent flow with a Kolmogorov spectrum can be easily recovered by employing standard methods for reducing α away from shocks.},

   abstract = {A new formulation is introduced for enforcing incompressibility in Smoothed Particle Hydrodynamics (SPH). The method uses a fractional step with the velocity field integrated forward in time without enforcing incompressibility. The resulting intermediate velocity field is then projected onto a divergence-free space by solving a pressure Poisson equation derived from an approximate pressure projection. Unlike earlier approaches used to simulate incompressible flows with SPH, the pressure is not a thermodynamic variable and the Courant condition is based only on fluid velocities and not on the speed of sound. Although larger time-steps can be used, the solution of the resulting elliptic pressure Poisson equation increases the total work per time-step. Efficiency comparisons show that the projection method has a significant potential to reduce the overall computational expense compared to weakly compressible SPH, particularly as the Reynolds number, Re, is increased. Simulations using this SPH projection technique show good agreement with finite-difference solutions for a vortex spin-down and Rayleigh-Taylor instability. The results, however, indicate that the use of an approximate projection to enforce incompressibility leads to error accumulation in the density field.},

For such flows, modification of the standard SPH formalism is required to minimize errors associated with the use of a quasi-incompressible equation of state. Treatment of viscosity, state equation, kernel interpolation, and boundary conditions are described. Simulations using the method show close agreement with series solutions for Couette and Poiseuille flows. Furthermore, comparison with finite element solutions for flow past a regular lattice of cylinders shows close agreement for the velocity and pressure fields. The SPH results exhibit small pressure fluctuations near curved boundaries. Further improvements to the boundary conditions may be possible which will reduce these errors. A similar method to that used here may permit the simulation of other flows at low Reynolds numbers using SPH. Further development will be needed for cases involving free surfaces or substantially different equations of state.},

These irregularly-spaced locations, hence referred to as “data points,” may have diverse meanings: in meterology, weather observation stations; in geography, surveyed locations; in city and regional planning, centers of data-collection zones; in biology, observation locations. It is assumed that a unique number (such as rainfall in meteorology, or altitude in geography) is associated with each data point. In order to display these data in some type of contour map or perspective view, to compare them with data for the same region based on other data points, or to analyze them for extremes, gradients, or other purposes, it is extremely useful, if not essential, to define a continuous function fitting the given values exactly. Interpolated values over a fine grid may then be evaluated.

   abstract = {Despite the popular view that social predators live in groups because group hunting facilitates prey capture, the apparent tendency for hunting success to peak at small group sizes suggests that the formation of large groups is unrelated to prey capture. Few empirical studies, however, have tested for nonlinear relationships between hunting success and group size, and none have demonstrated why success trails off after peaking. Here, we use a unique dataset of observations of individually known wolves (Canis lupus) hunting elk (Cervus elaphus) in Yellowstone National Park to show that the relationship between success and group size is indeed nonlinear and that individuals withholding effort (free riding) is why success does not increase across large group sizes. Beyond 4 wolves, hunting success leveled off, and individual performance (a measure of effort) decreased for reasons unrelated to interference from inept hunters, individual age, or size. But performance did drop faster among wolves with an incentive to hold back, i.e., nonbreeders with no dependent offspring, those performing dangerous predatory tasks, i.e., grab- bing and restraining prey, and those in groups of proficient hunters. These results suggest that decreasing performance was free riding and that was why success leveled off in groups with.4 wolves that had superficially appeared to be cooperating. This is the first direct evidence that nonlinear trends in group hunting success reflect a switch from cooperation to free riding. It also highlights how hunting success per se is unlikely to promote formation and maintenance of large groups.},

   abstract = {We revisit the problem of computing the topology and geometry of a real algebraic plane curve. The topology is of prime interest but geometric information, such as the position of singular and critical points, is also relevant. A challenge is to compute efficiently this information for the given coordinate system even if the curve is not in generic position. Previous methods based on the cylindrical algebraic decomposition use sub-resultant sequences and computations with polynomials with algebraic coefficients. A novelty of our approach is to replace these tools by Gröbner basis computations and isolation with rational univariate representations. This has the advantage of avoiding computations with polynomials with algebraic coefficients, even in non-generic positions. Our algorithm isolates critical points in boxes and computes a decomposition of the plane by rectangular boxes. This decomposition also induces a new approach for computing an arrangement of polylines isotopic to the input curve. We also present an analysis of the complexity of our algorithm. An implementation of our algorithm demonstrates its efficiency, in particular on high-degree non-generic curves.},

@article{Liao2014,
   abstract = {Many models of shallow water waves, such as the famous Camassa-Holm equation, admit peaked solitary waves. However, it is an open question whether or not the widely accepted peaked solitary waves can be derived from the fully nonlinear wave equations. In this paper, a unified wave model (UWM) based on the symmetry and the fully nonlinear wave equations is put forward for progressive waves with permanent form in finite water depth. Different from traditional wave models, the flows described by the UWM are not necessarily irrotational at crest, so that it is more general. The unified wave model admits not only the traditional progressive waves with smooth crest, but also a new kind of solitary waves with peaked crest that include the famous peaked solitary waves given by the Camassa-Holm equation. Besides, it is proved that Kelvin's theorem still holds everywhere for the newly found peaked solitary waves. Thus, the UWM unifies, for the first time, both of the traditional smooth waves and the peaked solitary waves. In other words, the peaked solitary waves are consistent with the traditional smooth ones. So, in the frame of inviscid fluid, the peaked solitary waves are as acceptable and reasonable as the traditional smooth ones. It is found that the peaked solitary waves have some unusual and unique characteristics. First of all, they have a peaked crest with a discontinuous vertical velocity at crest. Especially, unlike the traditional smooth waves that are dispersive with wave height, the phase speed of the peaked solitary waves has nothing to do with wave height, but depends (for a fixed wave height) on its decay length, i.e., the actual wavelength: in fact, the peaked solitary waves are dispersive with the actual wavelength when wave height is fixed. In addition, unlike traditional smooth waves whose kinetic energy decays exponentially from free surface to bottom, the kinetic energy of the peaked solitary waves either increases or almost keeps the same. All of these unusual properties show the novelty of the peaked solitary waves, although it is still an open question whether or not they are reasonable in physics if the viscosity of fluid and surface tension are considered. ?? 2013 Elsevier B.V.},

In this paper we examine the effect of surface tension on this scenario. We find that we obtain three different physical regimes depending on the strength of the surface tension. For weak surface tension. the propagation of the wave packets is very similar to that in the zero surface tension case. For strong nsurface tension, the evolution is again governed by a pair of KdV equations, but the coefficients in these equations have changed in such a way that the KdV soliton now represents a wave of depression on the fluid surface. Finally, at a special, intermediate value of the surface tension (where the Bond number equals (1)/(3)) the KdV description breaks down and it is necessary to introduce a new approximating\nequation, the Kawahara equation. which is a fifth order. nonlinear\npartial differential equation. In each of these regimes we give rigorous\nestimates of the difference between the solution of the appropriate\nmodulation equation and the Solution of the true water-wave problem.},

This system of evolution PDEs is a classical isentropic Euler system perturbed by a dispersive (third order) term. The Euler equations are discretized with a classical scheme (e.g. Roe, Rusanov or Lax-Friedrichs scheme) whereas the dispersive term is discretized with centered finite differences. We first prove that a certain amount of numerical viscosity is needed for a difference scheme to be stable in the Von Neumann sense. Then we consider the entropy stability of difference approximations. For that purpose, we introduce an additional unknown, the gradient of a function of the density. The Euler-Korteweg system is transformed into a hyperbolic system perturbed by a second order skew symmetric term. We prove entropy stability of Lax-Friedrichs type schemes under a suitable Courant-Friedrichs-Levy condition. We validate our approach numerically on a simple case and then carry out numerical simulations of a shallow water system with surface tension which models thin films down an incline. In addition, we propose a spatial discretization of the Euler-Korteweg system seen as a Hamiltonian system of evolution PDEs. This spatial discretization preserves the Hamiltonian structure and thus is naturally entropy conservative. This scheme makes possible the numerical simulation of the dispersive shock waves of the Euler Korteweg system.},

Ultraviolet divergences are touched on, but are dealt with more thoroughly in the following paper where specific models are examined.

   abstract = {We construct noninteracting wave patterns (i.e., asymptotic states) for a conservation law with a general moving source term. When nonlinear resonance occurs, which is the case when the characteristic speed is near the speed of the source, instability may result. We identify a stability criterion which is independent of the flux function. This is so, even if composite wave patterns exist, as may be the case for nonconvex flux functions. We study the general scalar model as well as transonic gas flows through a duct with varying cross section. For the latter case, noninteracting wave patterns for such a flow are constructed for arbitrary equations of state. It is shown that the stability of a wave pattern depends on the geometry of the duct, and not on the equation of the state. In particular, transonic steady shock waves along a converging duct are unstable, and flow along a diverging duct is always stable.},

Resonance occurs when the speed of the source is too close to one of the characteristic speeds of the system. For the nonlinear system characteristic speeds depend on the basic dependence variables and resonance gives rise to nonlinear interactions which lead to rich wave phenomena. Motivated by physical examples a scalar model is proposed and analyzed to describe the qualitative behavior of waves for a general system in resonance with the source. Analytical understanding is used to design a numerical scheme based on the random choice method. An important physical example is transonic gas flow through a nozzle. This analysis provides a transparent and revealing qualitative understanding of wave behavior of gas flow, including such phenomena as nonlinear stability, instability, and changing types of waves.},

This is achieved by means of a kinetic approach to the system, which is the departing point of the method developed here. In this context, we use a natural description of the microscopic behavior of the system to define numerical fluxes at the interfaces of an unstructured mesh. We also use the concept of cell-centered conservative quantities (as usual in the finite volume method) and upwind interfacial sources as advocated by several authors. We show, analytically and also by means of numerical results, that the above properties are satisfied.},

The interaction of such sharply defined wave fronts and more generally of nonlinear hyperbolic waves is of fundamental importance and includes such phenomena as Mach triple point formation, shock wave diffraction patterns and the study of Riemann problems in one and higher dimensions. Recent progress in the study of nonlinear hyperbolic wave interactions has revealed a surprising range of new mathematical phenomena and structures. This mathematical theory should be useful in the design of improved computational algorithms and in part was motivated by such considerations. It is also of considerable interest for its own sake as new mathematical phenomena as well as in terms of the direct insight it provides into physical phenomena. Within the subject matter and point of view adopted here, we have attempted to present a broad and, we hope, a representative account of recent progress.},

Adapting a procedure used earlier for the field-free case, we determine analytically a set of boundary layer solutions and combine them numerically with the Chapman-Enskog solutions to satisfy various boundary conditions at the wall, albeit approximately. Various aspects of the solutions so obtained are presented, in particular the profiles of the density and the kinetic energy density in the boundary layer. The most important quantity that can be extracted from them is the effective absorption rate at the wall corresponding to complete or partial absorption of particles hitting the wall. This quantity is noticeably increased by the presence of the external field; as in the field-free case it also depends on the reflection mechanism adopted for the non-absorbed particles. The trends in the absorption rate, and even their numerical values, are predicted remarkably well by a simple analytical approximation, a self-consistent modification of the usual transition state theory for chemical reactions.},

By deriving the Fokker-Planck equation, the model is shown to be consistent with the two-dimensional advection-diffusion equation with space-varying dispersion coefficient and water depth. To improve the behaviour of the model shortly after the deployment of the pollutant, a random flight model is developed too. It is shown that over long simulation periods, this model is again consistent with the advection-diffusion equation. The various numerical aspects of the implementation of the stochastic models are discussed and finally a realistic application to predict the dispersion of a pollutant in the Eastern Scheldt estuary is described.},

   abstract = {In this paper we present an Eulerian-Lagrangian numerical simulation (LNS) scheme for particulate flows. The overall algorithm in the present approach is a variation of the scheme presented earlier. In this numerical scheme we solve the fluid phase continuity and momentum equations on an Eulerian grid. The particle motion is governed by Newton's law thus following the Lagrangian approach. Momentum exchange from the particle to fluid is modeled in the fluid phase momentum equation. Forces acting on the particles include drag from the fluid, body force and the interparticle force that prevents the particle volume fraction from exceeding the close-packing limit. There is freedom to use different models for these forces and to introduce other forces. In this paper we have used two types of interparticle forces. The effect of viscous stresses are included in the fluid phase equations. The volume fraction of the particles appear in the fluid phase continuity and momentum equations. The fluid and particle momentum equations are coupled in the solution procedure unlike an earlier approach. A finite volume method is used to solve these equations on an Eulerian grid. Particle positions are updated explicitly. This numerical scheme can handle a range of particle loadings and particle types. We solve the fluid phase continuity and momentum equations using a Chorin-type fractional-step method. The numerical scheme is verified by comparing results with test cases and experiments.},

   abstract = {Geometric Algebra is an extension to the linear algebra usually used to describe geometric spaces. It unites Grassmann's inner and outer product into the associative geometric product and allows for the description of geometric objects and transformations like projections and rotations without referring to matrices. Also, algebraic objects described with Geometric Algebra often encode additional information like direction, handedness etc. and have other useful properties. While Geometric Algebra methods have been successfully applied to a variety of problems in the recent past, including computer vision, robotics and relativistic electro-magnetic field theory, its applications to the field of fluid dynamics have been restricted to isolated subjects or specialized problem descriptions. The systematic development of a comprehensive fluid dynamics calculus using Geometric Algebra methods is still an open task. This work will derive the Navier-Stokes equations, which describe a general fluid flow, out of basic physical principles like conservation of mass, balance of momentum and conservations of energy, thus preparing the ground for more in-depth research. While Geometric Algebra does not add greatly to purely scalar equations, it does facilitate their derivation, often making it quicker, easier to understand and, above all, valid in arbitrary dimensions and spaces. Promising results are also achieved in the description of vorticity and rotation as well as the stream function, which can be formulated in higherdimensional and less restricted spaces employing Geometric Algebra.},

   abstract = {Recently, it has been shown that for strong upstream magnetic field, stationary three-dimensional magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) bow shock flows exhibit a complex double-front shock topology with particular segments of the shock fronts being of the intermediate MHD shock type. The large-scale stability of this new bow shock topology is investigated. Two types of numerical experiments are described in which the upstream flow is perturbed in a time-dependent manner. It is found that large-amplitude noncyclic localized perturbations may cause the disintegration of the intermediate shocks, which are indeed known to be unstable against perturbations with integrated amplitudes above critical values, but that in the driven bow shock problem there are always shock front segments where intermediate shocks are reformed dynamically, resulting in the reappearance of the new double-front topology with intermediate-shock segments after the perturbation has passed. These MHD results indicate a theoretical mechanism for the possible intermittent formation of shock segments of intermediate type in unsteady space physics bow shock flows when upstream magnetic fields are strong, for example, in the terrestrial bow shock during periods of strong interplanetary magnetic field, which are more common under solar maximum conditions, or in leading shock fronts induced by fast coronal mass ejections in the solar corona. It remains to be confirmed if intermediate-shock segments would be formed when kinetic effects and realistic dissipation in real space plasmas are taken into account. The detailed interaction of realistic, wave-like cyclic perturbations with the intermediate-shock segments in bow shock flows may lead to unsteady structures composed of (time-dependent) intermediate shocks, rotational discontinuities, and nonlinear wave trains, as in the scenarios proposed by Markovskii and Skorokhodov [2000]. The possible relevance of the new bow shock topology with intermediate shocks for space weather phenomena is discussed.},

   abstract = {Two types of small-amplitude capillary-gravity solitary waves are known to exist. One type bifurcates from a uniform flow when the Froude number is equal to 1 and the Weber number larger than 1/3. The other type bifurcates from a train of infinitesimal periodic waves at the minimum of the dispersion curve for all values of the Froude number between 0 (infinite depth) and 1. We investigate numerically the behavior of these waves away from their bifurcation point and show that these two types are globally connected. Moreover new families of capillary-gravity solitary waves of finite amplitude are shown to exist.},

   abstract = {Solitary water waves travelling through a forked channel region are studied via a new nonlinear wave model. This novel (reduced) one-dimensional (1D) model captures the effective features of the reflection and transmission of solitary waves passing through a two-dimensional (2D) branching channel region. Using an appropriate change of coordinates, the 2D wave system is defined in a simpler geometric configuration that allows a straightforward reduction to a 1D graph-like configuration. The Jacobian of the change of coordinates leads to a variable coefficient in the 1D model, which contains information about the angles of the diverting reaches, a feature that is not present in any previous water wave model on networks. Furthermore, this new formulation is more general, in allowing both symmetric and asymmetric branching configurations to be considered. A new compatibility condition is deduced, which is used at the corresponding branching node. The 2D and 1D dynamics are compared, with very good agreement.},

The grids with finer mesh width in space also have a smaller mesh width in time, making this a mesh refinement algorithm in time and space.

A basic lemma concerning the necessary condition for convergence is proved. Examples are given of a difference scheme for Sturm-Liouville type operators in the class of sufficiently smooth coefficients, of a scheme for the first boundary problem in the class of smooth coefficients and in the class of discontinuous coefficients, as well as in the class of piece-wise continuous coefficients. The latter is the basic class of coefficients which is discussed in the article.

The assumptions in this paper are less restrictive than those considered so far in the literature allowing also variable coefficients, mixed derivatives and polygonal domains. The nonequidistant grids we consider are more flexible than merely rectangular ones such that, e.g., local grid refinements are covered. The results also develop a close relation between supraconvergent finite difference schemes and piecewise linear finite element methods. It turns out that the finite difference equation is a certain nonstandard finite element scheme on triangular girds combined with a special form of quadrature. In extension to what is known for the standard finite element scheme, here also the gradient is shown to be convergent of second order, and so our result is also a superconvergence result for the underlying finite element method.},

   abstract = {In the present article we describe a few simple and efficient finite volume type schemes on moving grids in one spatial dimension for the sake of simplicity. The underlying finite volume scheme is conservative and it is accurate up to the second order in space. The main novelty consists in the motion of the grid. This new dynamic aspect can be used to resolve better the areas with high solution gradients or any other special features. No interpolation procedure is employed, thus an unnecessary solution smearing is avoided. Thus, our method enjoys excellent conservation properties. The resulting grid is completely redistributed according to the choice of the so-called monitor function. Several more or less universal choices of the monitor function are provided. Finally, the performance of the proposed algorithm is illustrated on several examples stemming from the simple linear advection to the simulation of complex shallow water waves. We believe that the techniques described in our paper can be beneficially used to model tsunami wave propagation and run-up.},

   abstract = {We develop efficient moving mesh algorithms for one- and two-dimensional hyperbolic systems of conservation laws. The algorithms are formed by two independent parts: PDE evolution and mesh-redistribution. The first part can be any appropriate high-resolution scheme, and the second part is based on an iterative procedure. In each iteration, meshes are first redistributed by an equidistribution principle, and then on the resulting new grids the underlying numerical solutions are updated by a conservative-interpolation formula proposed in this work. The iteration for the mesh-redistribution at a given time step is complete when the meshes governed by a nonlinear equationreach the equilibrium state. The main idea of the proposed method is to keep the mass-conservation of the underlying numerical solution at each redistribution step. In one dimension, we can show that the underlying numerical approximation obtained in the mesh-redistribution part satisfies the desired TVD property, which guarantees that the numerical solution at any time level is TVD, provided that the PDE solver in the first part satisfies such a property. Several test problems in one and two dimensions are computed using the proposed moving mesh algorithm. The computations demonstrate that our methods are efficient for solving problems with shock discontinuities, obtaining the same resolution with a much smaller number of grid points than the uniform mesh approach.},

Application of the abstract properties of the multi-symplectic structures framework leads to a new variational principle for space-time periodic states reminiscent of the variational principle for invariant tori, a geometric reformulation of the concepts of action and action flux, a rigorous proof of the instability criterion predicted by the Whitham modulation equations, a new symplectic decomposition of the Noether theory, generalization of the concept of reversibility to space-time and a proof of Lighthill's geometric criterion for instability of periodic waves travelling in one space dimension. The nonlinear Schrödinger equation and the water-wave problem are characterized as Hamiltonian systems on a multi-symplectic structure for example. Further ramifications of the generalized symplectic structure of theoretical and practical interest are also discussed.},

Then, the implicit midpoint rule is employed for time integration to obtain the MSFP method for the 2D-HPDE. The fully discrete multi-symplectic conservation laws are also obtained. In addition, the proposed method is applied to solve the Zakharov-Kuznetsov (ZK) equation and the Kadomtsev-Petviashvili (KP) equation.

   abstract = {The classical Boussinesq equations only incorporate weak dispersion and weak nonlinearity, and are valid only for long waves in shallow waters. The classical Serre equations (or Green and Naghdi) are fully-nonlinear and weakly dispersive. Thus, as for the classical Boussinesq models, Serre's equations are valid only for shallow water conditions. To allow applications in a greater range of depth to wavelength ratio, a new set of extended Serre equations with additional terms of dispersive origin is proposed in this work. The equations are solved using an efficient finite-difference method, which consistency and stability are tested by comparison with a closed-form solitary wave solution of these equations. It is shown that computed results agree closely with the analytical ones and test data. An equivalent form of the Boussinesq equations, also with improved linear dispersion characteristics, is solved using a numerical procedure similar to that used to solve the extended Serre equations. Numerical solutions of both approaches, in the case of waves generated by disturbances on the water surface, are compared to each other and with available data, testing different functions commonly used in modelling the generation and propagation of ship waves.},

Recently, Riemann solver-based techniques such as Roe’s scheme have become a successful tool for numerical simulation of other conservation laws like the shallow water equations. One of the disadvantages of this technique is related to the treatment of the source terms of the equations. The conservativity of the scheme can be seriously damaged if a careless treatment is applied. Previous papers studied the way to treat the terms arising from bed level changes. This paper deals with the analysis of the main reasons leading to a correct treatment of the geometrical source terms, that is, those representing the changes in cross-section which may be linked to the specific dependence of the flux function on the geometry.},

In contrast to conventional data reconstruction methods based on conservative variables, the water surface level is chosen as the basis for data reconstruction. This provides accurate values of the conservative variables at cell interfaces so that the fluxes can be accurately calculated with a Riemann solver. The main advantages are: (1) a simple centered discretization is used for the source terms; (2) the scheme is no more complicated than the conventional method for the homogeneous terms; (3) small perturbations in the water surface elevation can be accurately predicted; and (4) the method is generally suitable for both steady and unsteady shallow-water problems. The accuracy of the scheme has been verified by recourse to both steady and unsteady flow problems. Excellent agreement has been obtained between the numerical predictions and analytical solutions. The results indicate that the new scheme is accurate, simple, efficient, and robust.},

In this Letter we deal with such a two-component integrable system of coupled equations. First we derive the system in the context of shallow water theory. Then we show that while small initial data develop into global solutions, for some initial data wave breaking occurs. We also discuss the solitary wave solutions. Finally, we present an explicit construction for the peakon solutions in the short wave limit of system.},

@article{Hayes2000,
   abstract = {We consider strictly hyperbolic systems of conservation laws whose characteristic fields are not genuinely nonlinear, and we introduce a framework for the nonclassical shocks generated by diffusive or diffusive-dispersive approximations. A nonclassical shock does not fulfill the Liu entropy criterion and turns out to be undercompressive. We study the Riemann problem in the class of solutions satisfying a single entropy inequality, the only such constraint available for general diffusive-dispersive approximations. Each non-genuinely nonlinear characteristic field admits a two-dimensional wave set, instead of the classical one-dimensional wave curve. In specific applications, these wave sets are narrow and resemble the classical curves. We find that even in strictly hyperbolic systems, nonclassical shocks with arbitrarily small amplitudes occur. The Riemann problem can be solved uniquely using nonclassical shocks, provided an additional constraint is imposed: we stipulate that the entropy dissipation across any nonclassical shock be a given constitutive function. We call this admissibility criterion a kinetic relation, by analogy with similar laws introduced in material science for propagating phase boundaries. In particular, the kinetic relation may be expressed as a function of the propagation speed. It is derived from traveling waves and, typically, depends on the ratioof the diffusion and dispersion parameters.},

The novelty here consists in the fact that the new model conserves the energy, contrary to other modified Serre’s equations found in the literature. Numerical comparisons with the Euler equations show that the new model is substantially more accurate than the classical Serre equations, especially for long time simulations and for large amplitudes.},

   abstract = {In this article, we present a model of heat transfer occurring through a liquid film flowing down a vertical wall. This new model is formally derived using the method of asymptotic expansions by introducing appropriately chosen dimensionless variables. In our study the small parameter, known as the film parameter, is chosen as the ratio of the flow depth to the characteristic wavelength. A new Nusselt solution is obtained, taking into account the hydrodynamic free surface variations and the contributions of the higher order terms coming from temperature variation effects. Comparisons are made with numerical solutions of the full Fourier equations in a steady state frame. The flow and heat transfer are coupled through Marangoni and temperature dependent viscosity effects. Even if these effects have been considered separately before, here a fully coupled model is proposed. Another novelty consists in the asymptotic approach in contrast to the weighted residual approach which have been formerly applied to these problems.},

The model consists of a depth-integrated continuity equation and momentum equations, in which the ground movement is the forcing function. These equations include full nonlinear, but weak frequency-dispersion, effects. The model is capable of describing wave propagation from relatively deep water to shallow water. Simplified models for waves generated by small seafloor displacement or creeping ground movement are also presented. A numerical algorithm is developed for the general fully nonlinear model. Comparisons are made with a boundary integral equation method model, and a deep-water limit for the depth-integrated model is determined in terms of a characteristic side length of the submarine mass. The importance of nonlinearity and frequency dispersion in the wave-generation region and on the shoreline movement is discussed.},

With the basic assumption that the depth is small in comparison with a horizontal length scale, three regimes of approximation are presented according to the magnitude of the wave amplitude, (a) When the amplitude is of the same order of magnitude as the depth, the Airy equations are rederived as the first approximation, (b) When the amplitude is comparable to the cube of the depth, both lengths being nondimensionalized with respect to a common horizontal scale, two high-order nonlinear equations are obtained which include the classical cnoidal wave as a special solution for a horizontal bottom. These equations may be transformed to a set of first-order quasi-linear hyperbolic equations with the characteristic curves in the x-t plane directly related to the bottom profile. To facilitate numerical computations they are then written as differential equations along the characteristics. In the third regime (c) of extremely small wave amplitudes the appropriate linearized equations are given.},

A boundary-integral method is used in the computation which is similar to that of Simmen & Saffman (1985) who describe such waves on deep water. Particular attention is given to the effects of finite depth with descriptions of waves of limiting steepness, waves with eddies beneath their crests and extremely high waves on high-speed flows. Many qualitative features of these waves are relevant to steep waves propagating in shallow water, or on a strong wind-induced drift current. An important practical point in the interpretation of wave measurements of wind driven waves is that mean kinetic energy and potential energy densities are unequal even for infinitesimal waves. This may mean that wave energy spectra deduced from surface-elevation measurements in the conventional way may sometimes be misleading.},

When this vorticity is assumed constant, a non-linear theory can be used, but for more general velocity distributions in the main stream it is necessary to linearize the problem. In the linearized theory, a general equation is obtained connecting the wave velocity with the velocity in the undisturbed stream and this is solved in several special cases. It is shown generally that the wave velocity relative to the mean flow is always greater than the value given by the classical theory. The wave velocity relative to the bottom of the stream has two values, one less than the minimum stream velocity and the other greater than the maximum stream velocity.},

The numerical models employed include the linear shallow water equations, a weakly nonlinear and dispersive model (Boussinesq equations), and ray theory for linear hydrostatic waves. Four different tsunami sources, constructed from inversion models based on seismo-logical recordings, are studied. We have investigated the sensitivity to the choice of mathematical model, grid resolution, source parameters, and delay of tsunami generation at the northern part of the source area. The results are compared to surface elevation recordings. Numerical simulations show that the effect of dispersion may modify the waves (slightly) during long propagation times only, and dispersion is not observed in the tsunami generation phase. In some shallow regions, on the other hand, nonlinear steepening of the wave front may enhance dispersion, and undular bores may be produced, which cannot be modeled by the standard shallow water equations commonly used for tsunami simulation. The sensitivity analysis results provide important insights to the source complexity of the Dec. 26, 2004, earthquake.},

   abstract = {Deformation of the Indian Ocean tsunami moving into the shallow Strait of Malacca and formation of undular bores and solitary waves in the strait are simulated in a model study using the fully nonlinear dispersive method (FNDM) and the Korteweg-deVries (KdV) equation. Two different versions of the incoming wave are studied where the waveshape is the same but the amplitude is varied: full amplitude and half amplitude. While moving across three shallow bottom ridges, the back face of the leading depression wave steepens until the wave slope reaches a level of 0.0036-0.0038, when short waves form, resembling an undular bore for both full and half amplitude. The group of short waves has very small amplitude in the beginning, behaving like a linear dispersive wave train, the front moving with the shallow water speed and the tail moving with the linear group velocity. Energy transfer from long to short modes is similar for the two input waves, indicating the fundamental role of the bottom topography to the formation of short waves. The dominant period becomes about 20 s in both cases. The train of short waves, emerging earlier for the larger input wave than for the smaller one, eventually develops into a sequence of rank-ordered solitary waves moving faster than the leading depression wave and resembles a fission of the mother wave. The KdV equation has limited capacity in resolving dispersion compared to FNDM.},

Rather than restricting the flows to be weak (but solutions to the relevant dynamics), we have considered motions where the streamfunction is only a kinematic model resembling the actual flows but the amplitude can be large so that flow speeds can greatly exceed the phase speed. For steadily propagating disturbances, there is an equivalent one-dimensional Lagrangian motion problem and we have applied results from analyses of such to periodic channel waves and isolated circular eddies. We show that the mean Lagrangian drift rate in periodic channel waves is very sensitive to the initial position and may be either prograde or retrograde. Large volumes of the fluid may be “trapped” to translate along with the wave. The wave drift depends on the phase velocity relative to the Eulerian mean flow and peaks at about 1/3 of the transient Eulerian speed at geophysically relevant amplitudes. For isolated eddies such as Gulf Stream rings, we calculate the trapped volume carried with the eddy and the displacements of the particles outside. We show that some particles may translate quite large distances along with the eddy while others move rapidly in the opposite direction and are left behind.},

In this study, a numerical code based on Nwogu's equations is developed. The model uses a fourth-order predictor-corrector method to advance in time, and discretizes first-order spatial derivatives to fourth-order accuracy, thus reducing all truncation errors to a level smaller than the dispersive terms retained by the model. The basic numerical scheme and associated boundary conditions are described. The model is applied to several examples of wave propagation in variable depth, and computed solutions are compared with experimental data. These initial results indicate that the model is capable of simulating wave transformation from relatively deep water to shallow water, giving accurate predictions of the height and shape of shoaled waves in both regular and irregular wave experiments.},

   abstract = {This paper supplements the validation of the fourth-order compact finite volume Boussinesq-type model presented by Cienfuegos et al. (Int. J. Numer. Meth. Fluids 2006, in press). We discuss several issues related to the application of the model for realistic wave propagation problems where boundary conditions and uneven bathymetries must be considered. We implement a moving shoreline boundary condition following the lines given by Lynett et al. (Coastal Eng. 2002; 46:89-107), while an absorbing-generating seaward boundary and an impermeable vertical wall boundary are approximated using a characteristic decomposition of the Serre equations. Using several benchmark tests, both numerical and experimental, we show that the new finite volume model is able to correctly describe nonlinear wave processes from shallow waters and up to wavelengths which correspond to the theoretical deep water limit. The results compare favourably with those reported using former fully nonlinear and weakly dispersive Boussinesq-type solvers even when time integration is conducted with Courant numbers greater than 1.0. Furthermore, excellent nonlinear performance is observed when numerical computations are compared with several experimental tests on solitary waves shoaling over planar beaches up to breaking. A preliminary test including the wave-breaking parameterization described by Cienfuegos (Fifth International Symposium on Ocean Wave Measurement Analysis, Madrid, Spain, 2005) shows that the Boussinesq model can be extended to deal with surf zone waves. Finally, practical aspects related to the application of a high-order implicit filter as given by Gaitonde et al. (Int. J. Numer. Methods Engng 1999; 45:1849-1869) to damp out unphysical wavelengths, and the numerical robustness of the finite volume scheme are also discussed.},

   abstract = {The Ligurian sea, at the France-Italy boarder of the Mediterranean Sea, has experienced in the past numerous submarine landslides within its very near continental slope, the continental shelf being very narrow. The most recent occurred on the 1979 October 16 near Nice international airport and generated tsunami waves of order 3 m of amplitude in some specific locations. More ancient landslides are also easily identified through bathymetric surveys of the seafloor. For the 1979 event we propose two distinct tsunamigenic landslides based on identified scars observable on the seafloor. The first one corresponds to the volume Vol1 that slid at the airport (in shallow water) while the second one corresponds to the more substantial volume Vol2 that has been localized at the slope. Former studies indicate that only the combination of the two slides may explain the event. We complement these studies by asserting that when the two slides are taken separately, they already explain a significant (although not a total) part of the event: Vol1 explains partly the tsunami observations in the vicinity of the airport while Vol2 contributes to explain the ones away from the area, in particular at Antibes where the highest wave has been observed. The modelling effort is then extended to evaluate the tsunamigenesis of selected (but representative) former landslides having a clear scar signature. The vulnerability of the area to landslide-triggered tsunami is then proposed to discussion along with possible mechanisms that can be responsible for local wave amplification.},

   abstract = {The likelihood of a large scale tsunami from the La Palma Island is considered small by most. Nevertheless, the potential catastrophic consequences call for attention. Here we report on numerical simulations of a tsunami that might result from the extreme case of a flank collapse of the Cumbre Vieja volcano at the La Palma Island, done by combining a multimaterial model for the wave generation with Boussinesq models for the far-field propagation. Our simulations show that the slide speed is close to critical, effectively generating an initial wave of several hundred meters height. Our main focus is the wave propagation which is genuinely dispersive. In the far-field, propagation becomes increasingly complex due to the combined effects of dispersion, refraction, and interference in the direction of propagation. Constructive interference of the trailing waves are found to decrease the decay of the maximum amplitude with distance compared to classical asymptotic theory at transatlantic distances. Thus, the commonly used hydrostatic models fail to describe the propagation. Consequences of the La Palma scenario would be largest at the Canary Islands, but our findings also suggests that the whole central Atlantic would face grave consequences. However, the largest surface elevations are smaller than the most pessimistic reports found in literature. We also find undular bores towards the shorelines of America.},

   abstract = {To study the waves and runup/rundown generated by a sliding mass, a numerical simulation model, based on the large-eddy-simulation (LES) approach, was developed. The Smagorinsky subgrid scale model was employed to provide turbulence dissipation and the volume of fluid (VOF) method was used to track the free surface and shoreline movements. A numerical algorithm for describing the motion of the sliding mass was also implemented. To validate the numerical model, we conducted a set of large-scale experiments in a wave tank of 104m long, 3.7m wide and 4.6m deep with a plane slope (1:2) located at one end of the tank. A freely sliding wedge with two orientations and a hemisphere were used to represent landslides. Their initial positions ranged from totally aerial to fully submerged, and the slide mass was also varied over a wide range. The slides were instrumented to provide position and velocity time histories. The time-histories of water surface and the runup at a number of locations were measured. Comparisons between the numerical results and experimental data are presented only for wedge shape slides. Very good agreement is shown for the time histories of runup and generated waves. The detailed three-dimensional complex flow patterns, free surface and shoreline deformations are further illustrated by the numerical results. The maximum runup heights are presented as a function of the initial elevation and the specific weight of the slide. The effects of the wave tank width on the maximum runup are also discussed.},

The maximum wave amplitude was three meters, and the sea oscillations lasted for several hours. The anomalous behaviour was seen in many places of the coast of Bulgaria and was stronger in the north. Several accounts of eyewitnesses as well as reports of local port authorities and three tide-gauge recordings are available and have been collected and analysed. The tsunami could have been produced by a submarine landslide or by atmospheric pressure pulses. Here, we explore the former hypothesis, i.e., the possibility that the tsunami was induced by a landslide that may have occurred on the shelf margin off Bulgaria. By making use of numerical modelling we find that submarine mass movements taking place within a certain delimited source area off Bulgaria may have generated tsunamis compatible with the observations.},

@article{Dressler1949,
   abstract = {The purpose of this paper is to obtain solutions which are periodic with respect to distance, describing the phenomenon called “roll-waves,” for water flow along a wide inclined channel, and to discuss the behavior of the mathematical solutions. The basic idea presented in Part I is that discontinuous periodic solutions can be constructed by joining together sections of a continuous solution through shocks (or “bores”). It is shown first that no continuous solutions can be periodic and that only one special continuous solution can be used as the basis for constructing discontinuous periodic solutions. The analysis is based upon the non-linear partial differential equations of the “shallow water theory,” augmented by the Cheay formula to allow for turbulent resistance. The Bresse profile equation is obtained in a form applicable for progressing wave flows. Shock conditions are derived for the case of an arbitrary continuous channel bed and for a flow subject to a resisting force. The special continuous solution is explicitly obtained and analyzed. Branches of it are then joined together through shocks. It is proved that roll-waves cannot occur either if the resistance is zero or if the resistance exceeds a certain critical value. As the resistance decreases, the size of the waves decreases also; and if the resistance becomes too large, the profiles reverse their direction and can no longer be joined by shocks. This critical value is reached when the (dimensionless) resistance coefficient equals one-fourth the value of the channel slope. The presence of a resistance force which varies merely with velocity is not sufficient to permit the construction of periodic solutions; the resistance must also act in such a manner that it decreases as the water depth increases. The analysis proves that the ratio of wave height to wave length of roll-waves is always independent of the speed of the waves. Explicit expressions for water height and shock height as functions of wave length are derived. The investigation studies the static discharge rate as a function of the wave speed, and asymptotic formulas for the wave speed in terms of the average discharge rate are derived. Twelve sets of curves arc presented, based on the equations obtained here, to illustrate the quantitative behavior of roll-waves; these may be used to check this theory against observed data. For prescribed values of slope, resistance, and wave speed, there is a one-parameter family of roll-wave solutions. If the wave length is also prescribed, the solution will then be unique.},

The restriction to classical logic is not meant to imply that this logic is intrinsically better than other, non-classical logics; however, classical logic is a good introduction to logic because of its simplicity, and a good basis for applications because it is the foundation of classical mathematics, and thus of the exact sciences which are based on it. The book is meant primarily for mathematics students who are already acquainted with some of the fundamental concepts of mathematics, such as that of a group. It should help the reader to see for himself the advantages of a formalisation. The step from the everyday language to a formalised language, which usually creates difficulties, is dis­ cussed and practised thoroughly. The analysis of the way in which basic mathematical structures are approached in mathematics leads in a natural way to the semantic notion of consequence. One of the substantial achievements of modern logic has been to show that the notion of consequence can be replaced by a provably equivalent notion of derivability which is defined by means of a calculus. Today we know of many calculi which have this property.},

   abstract = {Model equations that govern the evolution of internal gravity waves at the interface of two immiscible inviscid fluids are derived. These models follow from the original Euler equations under the sole assumption that the waves are long compared to the undisturbed thickness of one of the fluid layers. No smallness assumption on the wave amplitude is made. Both shallow and deep water configurations are considered, depending on whether the waves are assumed to be long with respect to the total undisturbed thickness of the fluids or long with respect to just one of the two layers, respectively. The removal of the traditional weak nonlinearity assumption is aimed at improving the agreement with the dynamics of Euler equations for large-amplitude waves. This is obtained without compromising much of the simplicity of the previously known weakly nonlinear models. Compared to these, the fully nonlinear models' most prominent feature is the presence of additional nonlinear dispersive terms, which coexist with the typical linear dispersive terms of the weakly nonlinear models. The fully nonlinear models contain the Korteweg-de Vries (KdV) equation and the Intermediate Long Wave (ILW) equation, for shallow and deep water configurations respectively, as special cases in the limit of weak nonlinearity and unidirectional wave propagation. In particular, for a solitary wave of given amplitude, the new models show that the characteristic wavelength is larger and the wave speed is smaller than their counterparts for solitary wave solutions of the weakly nonlinear equations. These features are compared and found in overall good agreement with available experimental data for solitary waves of large amplitude in two-fluid systems.},

   abstract = {Surface water waves in ideal fluids have been typically modeled by asymptotic approximations of the full Euler equations. Some of these simplified models lose relevant properties of the full water wave problem. One of these properties is the Galilean symmetry, that is, the invariance under Galilean transformations. In this paper, a mechanism to incorporate Galilean invariance in classical water wave models is proposed. The technique is applied to the Benajmin-Bona-Mahony (BBM) equation and the Peregrine (classical Boussinesq) system, leading to the corresponding Galilean invariant versions of these models. Some properties of the new equations are presented, with special emphasis on the computation and interaction of solitary wave solutions. A comparison with the Euler equations demonstrates the relevance of the Galilean invariance in the description of water waves. © 2013 by the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.},

The first one corresponds to the classical situation of an elastic homogeneous and isotropic half-space, which is traditionally used for the generation of tsunamis. The second test case takes into account the presence of a sediment layer separating the oceanic column from the hard rock. Some important differences are revealed.

The present work is entirely devoted to thorough analysis of the dispersion relation of the novel visco-potential formulation. Namely, in this study we relax all assumptions of the weak dependence of the wave frequency on time. As a result, we have to deal with complex integro-differential equations that describe transient behaviour of the phase and group velocities. Using numerical computations, we show several snapshots of these important quantities at different times as functions of the wave number. Good qualitative agreement with previous study [D. Dutykh, Eur. J. Mech. B/Fluids 28 (2009) 430] is obtained. Thus, we validate in some sense approximations made anteriorly. There is an unexpected conclusion of this study. According to our computations, the bottom boundary layer creates disintegrating modes in the group velocity. In the same time, the imaginary part of the phase velocity remains negative for all times. This result can be interpreted as a new kind of instability which is induced by the bottom boundary layer effect. © 2009 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

In particular, we show that the associated Navier-Stokes equations can be reduced to a set of coupled dispersive Camassa-Holm type equations. These support inviscid and smooth localized travelling waves, which are numerically computed using the Petviashvili method. In physical space they correspond to localized toroidal vortices that concentrate near the pipe boundaries (wall vortexons) or wrap around the pipe axis (centre vortexons) in agreement with the analytical soliton solutions derived by Fedele (2012 Fluid Dyn. Res. 44 45509) for small and long-wave disturbances. Inviscid singular vortexons with discontinuous radial velocities are also numerically discovered as associated to special travelling waves with a wedge-type singularity, viz. peakons. Their existence is confirmed by an analytical solution of exponentially shaped peakons that is obtained for the particular case of the uncoupled Camassa-Holm equations. The evolution of a perturbation is also investigated using an accurate Fourier-type spectral scheme. We observe that an initial vortical patch splits into a centre vortexon radiating vorticity in the form of wall vortexons. These can under go further splitting before viscosity dissipates them, leading to a slug of centre vortexons. The splitting process originates from a radial flux of azimuthal vorticity from the wall to the pipe axis in agreement with Eyink (2008 Physica D 237 1956-68). The inviscid and smooth vortexon is similar to the nonlinear neutral structures derived by Walton (2011 J.

   abstract = {We present a new Hamiltonian formulation for the non-linear evolution of surface gravity waves over a variable impermeable bottom. The derivation is based on Luke’s variational principle and the use of an exact (convergent up to the boundaries) infinite-series representation of the unknown wave potential, in terms of a system of prescribed vertical functions (explicitly dependent on the local depth and the local free-surface elevation) and unknown horizontal modal amplitudes. The key idea of this approach is the introduction of two unconventional modes ensuring a rapid convergence of the modal series. The fully nonlinear water-wave problem is reformulated as two evolution equations, essentially equivalent with the Zakharov-Craig-Sulem formulation. The Dirichlet-to-Neumann operator (DtN) over arbitrary bathymetry is determined by means of a few first modes, the two unconventional ones being most important. While this formulation is exact, its numerical implementation, even for general domains, is not much more involved than that of the various simplified models (Boussinesq, Green-Nagdhi) widely used in engineering applications. The efficiency of this formulation is demonstrated by the excellent agreement of the numerical and experimental results for the case of the classical Beji-Battjes experiment.

The model is applied to four different cases of confined and unconfined flow in straight channels. The density current is generated by injecting a heavier fluid as a plug flow at the upstream boundary of the channel. The inflow transforms into a density current within a short distance. The current increases in thickness by entraining the ambient lighter fluid as it travels in the downstream direction. In the unconfined cases, the flow begins to spill in the lateral direction as soon as its thickness exceeds the bank height. The spilling results in a distinct lateral flow in the overbank area and limits the growth of the current in the vertical direction. The vertical structure of the overbank flow in the lateral direction is found to be similar to the primary flow structure of a density current. The magnitude of the lateral flow is found to depend strongly on the lateral slope of the floodplain. In the confined case, high sidewalls keep the flow inside the channel and the current continues to grow in the vertical direction. Two weak circulation cells are observed near the sidewalls in all cases. These circulation cells may act to redistribute fluid density across a channel cross-section. Although the model is applied here to a conservative density current, the analysis is valid in general for turbidity current driven by fine sediment.},

At the apex of a channel bend, different layers of the density current display a varied but considerable degree of superelevation.

The strength of the bottom dominant cell is found to be similar to that of the single circulation cell observed in the subaerial environment. Significant flow stripping occurs towards the outside overbank area in the uncontined case. Due to the dominant effect of stripping, the secondary flow becomes muted and only one circulation cell develops near the channel bottom in this case.

   abstract = {Sediment gravity flows, particularly those in the marine environment, are dynamically interesting because of the non-linear interaction of mixing, sediment entrainment/suspension and water-column stratification. Turbidity currents, which are strongly controlled by mixing at their fronts, are the best understood mode of sediment gravity flows. The type of mixing not only controls flow and deposition near the front, but also changes the dynamics of turbidity currents flowing in self-formed channels. Debris flows, on the other hand, mix little with ambient fluid. In fact, they have been shown to hydroplane, i.e. glide on a thin film of water. Hydroplaning enables marine debris flows to runout much farther than their subaerial equivalents. Some sediment gravity flows require external energy, from sources such as surface waves. When these flows are considered as stratification-limited turbidity currents, models are able to predict observed downslope sediment fluxes. Most marine sediment gravity flows are supercritical and thus controlled by sediment supply to the water column. Therefore, the genesis of the flows is the key to their understanding and prediction. Virtually every subaqueous failure produces a turbidity current, but they engage only a small percentage of the initially failed material. Wave-induced resuspension can produce and sustain sediment gravity flows.

Ultimately, only integrative numerical models can connect these related phenomena, and supply realistic predictions of the marine record.},

   abstract = {A numerical model of turbidity currents with a deforming bottom boundary has been developed. The model predicts the vertical structure of the flow velocity and concentration as well as change in the bed level due to erosion and deposition of suspended sediment. The Reynolds-averaged Navier–Stokes equations for dilute suspension have been solved using a finite volume method. The bottom boundary and the grid system are allowed to adjust in response to sediment deposition and entrainment during the computation. The model has been applied to simulate the evolution of a conservative saline density current and turbidity currents along an 11.6m long flume that includes a slope followed by a horizontal bed. The model successfully simulates the evolution of the currents. Model results have been compared with the experimental data. Good similarity profiles of velocity and excess density or suspended sediment concentration are obtained at both the upstream supercritical and the downstream subcritical flow regions. A turbulent Schmidt number larger than one has been found to be appropriate for providing a good match with the experimental data. Changes in bed level predicted by the model have also been found to be in agreement with the experiment data.7},

We develop spreading laws for gravity plumes which propagate laterally as well as longitudinally on a uniform slope. Examples of such flows are turbidity currents in the ocean and ignimbrite flows in the atmosphere. Laboratory experiments with a large tank, employing saline density currents, coupled with dimensional analysis, have been used to develop simple expressions for spreading rates of three-dimensional flows on sloping beds. Characteristic length and time are determined by the flow discharge and the buoyancy flux at the inlet. By knowing the initial width of the flow, the spreading laws can be used to estimate the maximum width of the current at different times as well as the longitudinal spreading rate. Predictions for flows compare favorably against observations.},

The model is applied to study the role that finer fractions of suspended sediment play in the evolution of a submarine fan due to the flow of a subsiding turbidity current. The depth-integrated model can treat multiple size fractions of suspended sediment, ranging from clay to coarse sand. The model is implemented in a sensitivity study by varying inflow fractions of suspended sediments. Computed results clearly indicate that a modest increase in fine sediment content in the inflow dramatically increases the sand carrying capacity of a turbidity current. It is also found that clay is more effective than fine or coarse silt in maintaining the momentum and the identity of a current. Downstream fining and gradual thinning of the simulated deposit is observed in computations performed with multiple grain sizes.},

The shallow water equations exhibit the major difficulties associated with the horizontal dynamical aspects of atmospheric modeling on the spherical earth. These cases are designed for use in the evaluation of numerical methods proposed for climate modeling and to identify the potential trade-offs which must always be made in numerical modeling. Before a proposed scheme is applied to a full baroclinic atmospheric model it must perform well on these problems in comparison with other currently accepted numerical methods. The cases are presented in order of complexity. They consist of advection across the poles, steady state geostrophically balanced flow of both global and local scales, forced nonlinear advection of an isolated low, zonal flow impinging on an isolated mountain, Rossby-Haurwitz waves, and observed atmospheric states. One of the cases is also identified as a computer performance/algorithm efficiency benchmark for assessing the performance of algorithms adapted to massively parallel computers.},

On the Sendai Plain, the maximum inundation height was 19.5 m, and the tsunami bore propagated more than 5 km inland. Along the ria coast from about 50 to 200 km north of Sendai, the narrow bays focused the tsunami waves, generating the largest inundation heights and run-ups.

Unlike the traditional approximation, this ‘non-traditional’ approximation captures the increase with height of the solid-body velocity due to planetary rotation. The conservation of energy, angular momentum and potential vorticity are ensured in the system. The caveats in extending the standard shallow-water wisdom to the case of the rotating sphere are exposed. Different derivations of the model are possible, being based, respectively, on (i) Hamilton’s principle for primitive equations with a complete Coriolis force, under the hypothesis of columnar motion, (ii) straightforward vertical averaging of the ‘non-traditional’ primitive equations, and (iii) a time-dependent change of independent variables in the primitive equations written in the curl (‘vector-invariant’) form, with subsequent application of the columnar motion hypothesis. An intrinsic, coordinate-independent form of the non-traditional equations on the sphere is then given, and used to derive hyperbolicity criteria and Rankine-Hugoniot conditions for weak solutions. The relevance of the model for the Earth’s atmosphere and oceans, as well as other planets, is discussed.},

The range of applicability of the model is discussed, and the conservation of potential vorticity along the trajectories is proved. The equations of stationary shallow water motions are presented in the form of Bernoulli and potential vorticity integrals, which relate the liquid depth to the stream function. The simplest stationary solutions that describe the equilibrium state differing from the spherically symmetric state and the zonal flows along the parallels are found. It is demonstrated that the stationary equations of the model admit the infinitely dimensional Lie group of equivalence.},

The outer flow is dictated by a hydraulically controlled wedge flow which provides a spatially accelerating shear layer and baroclinic generation of vorticity along the inclined interface. A new, finite-amplitude mechanism is observed in which the core of the growing vortex is separated from the vorticity source at the interface. A secondary core develops and an altered vortex pairing interaction is observed. A spatial linear stability analysis reveals that one of two modified Kelvin-Helmholtz modes is dominant, resulting in the centre of the instability being offset from the density interface into the slower moving stream. Digital particle imaging velocimetry (DPIV) measurements are presented along with flow visualization which indicate that the mechanism is a result of the offset in the vortex core from the source of vorticity at the interface combined with the effects of spatial acceleration and buoyancy. The mixing induced by the interfacial instabilities is such that a sharp density interface remains near the high-momentum stream, with a low-gradient region extending into the low-momentum stream.},

The mixing and entrainment mechanisms at the shear interface are explored with the use of imaging techniques. The initial, unstable accelerating region, characterized by rapid development, low shear layer Richardson numbers and high entrainment rates, is limited by the effects of stratification which suppress the large-scale overturning. A subsequent high Richardson number region is characterized by weak entrainment and the collapse of turbulence from the initial region. The flow approaches a quasi-stable state as the mixed layer draws energy from the accelerating density current. Observed large-scale structure is attributed to an instability of the marginally unstable shear layer. Entrainment rates are calculated within each region for the various slopes considered and estimates for the extent of the transition regions are obtained.},

   abstract = {The analysis of flow over a slowly perturbed bottom (when perturbations have a typical length scale much larger than channel height) is often based on the shallow-water (or Saint-Venant) equations with the addition of a wall-friction term which is a local function of the mean velocity. By this choice, small sinusoidal disturbances of wall stress and mean velocity are bound to be in phase with each other. In contrast, studies of shorter-scale disturbances have long established that a phase lead develops between wall stress and mean velocity, with a crucial destabilizing effect on sediment transport along an erodible bed. The purpose of this paper is to calculate the wall-shear stress under large length-scale conditions and provide corrections to the Saint-Venant model.},

A numerical model is developed for the weakly nonlinear version of the model based on a combined finite-volume and finite-difference method with a fourth-order MUSCL-TVD scheme in space and a third-order SSP Runge-Kutta scheme in time. In the context of tsunami generation and propagation over trans-oceanic distances, a scaling analysis reveals that the importance of frequency dispersion increases with a decrease of the source width, while the effect of the Coriolis force increases with an increase of the source width. A sensitivity analysis to dispersive and Coriolis effects is carried out using the numerical model in a series of numerical experiments in an idealized ocean using Gaussian and di-polar sources with different source sizes. A simulation of the Tohoku 2011 tsunami is used to illustrate the effects of dispersive and Coriolis effects at large distances from the source region.},

Moreover, an intrinsic connection is constructed between the singular traveling waves and quadratic singular curves in the phase plane of traveling wave system. The new singular periodic waves, pseudo-cuspons, and compactons emerge if corresponding periodic orbits or homoclinic orbits are tangent to a hyperbola, ellipse, and parabola.

First, theoretical models for internal solitary waves in the ocean are briefly described. Various nonlinear analytical solutions are treated, commencing with the well-known Boussinesq and Korteweg-de Vries equations. Then certain generalizations are considered, including effects of cubic nonlinearity, Earth's rotation, cylindrical divergence, dissipation, shear flows, and others. Recent theoretical models for strongly nonlinear internal waves are outlined. Second, examples of experimental evidence for the existence of solitons in the upper ocean are presented; the data include radar and optical images and in situ measurements of wave forms, propagation speeds, and dispersion characteristics. Third, and finally, action of internal solitons on sound wave propagation is discussed. This review paper is intended for researchers from diverse backgrounds, including acousticians, who may not be familiar in detail with soliton theory. Thus, it includes an outline of the basics of soliton theory. At the same time, recent theoretical and observational results are described which can also make this review useful for mainstream oceanographers and theoreticians.},

As opposed to water waves, mixed interfacial waves exist even for pure gravity waves. The stability of traveling and standing waves with respect to three‐dimensional modulations is then studied. By using the method of multiple scales, Davey-Stewartson‐type equations are obtained. A detailed stability analysis is performed in three cases: pure gravity waves, capillary–gravity waves when one layer is infinitely deep, and capillary-gravity waves when both layers are infinitely deep. The main results for oblique (i.e., combined longitudinal and transverse) modulations reveal a mostly stabilizing effect of the density ratio for traveling waves and a destabilizing effect for standing waves.},

Our purpose is to study the significance of dispersive vs. non-dispersive long waves on global tsunami propagation. A tool which is well suited to revealing tsunami wave transformations is the energy flux. Expressions for dispersive and non-dispersive fluxes have been formulated. This provides an understanding of the role of dispersion in tsunami propagation and dissipation. Separating the pressure field into two parts i.e., HY and NHY shows that dispersive waves extract energy from the main wave, directing the dispersive energy flux away from the wave front. The major result of the application of the energy flux to non-dispersive waves is an enhanced understanding of later tsunami wave train arrivals at distant points - with arrivals sometimes occurring several hours after an initial forerunner wave. Computations show that strong differences between non-dispersive and dispersive waves develop along the length of the main energy beam. This has important consequences for accurate tsunami prediction and warnings.},

This formulation is put into the context of Boussinesq equations in general in an appendix. Describing first the discretization in detail, we design higher order numerical differences, analyse dispersion, stability and the convergence rate of the iteration scheme used at each time step. The performance of the present model is also compared to state of the art models (FUNWAVE/COULWAVE). A selection of tests are performed to validate the code and assess the applicability and accuracy of the method. The tests include eigenoscillations in basins, solitary wave propagation, comparison with pre-existing models, diffraction of incident solitary waves by a vertical cylinder and trans-Atlantic propagation of a hypothetical tsunami from the La Palma island. The latter case is pursued further in a companion paper. All tests indicate that the model is correctly coded, efficient and robust.},

The dispersive propagation of tsunamis can be simulated by use of the Boussinesq model, but the model demands many computational resources. However, rapid progress has been made in parallel computing technology. In this study, we investigated a parallelized approach for dispersive tsunami wave modeling. Our new parallel software solves the nonlinear Boussinesq dispersive equations in spherical coordinates. A variable nested algorithm was used to increase spatial resolution in the target region. The software can also be used to predict tsunami inundation on land. We used the dispersive tsunami model to simulate the 2011 Tohoku earthquake on the Supercomputer K. Good agreement was apparent between the dispersive wave model results and the tsunami waveforms observed offshore. The finest bathymetric grid interval was 2/9 arcsec (approx. 5 m) along longitude and latitude lines. Use of this grid simulated tsunami soliton fission near the Sendai coast. Incorporating the three-dimensional shape of buildings and structures led to improved modeling of tsunami inundation.},

The present study shows that tsunami prediction from a seismic centroid moment tensor (CMT) solution would work satisfactorily for the 2013 Santa Cruz Islands earthquake (Mw 8.0) tsunami even though the earthquake source had been modeled as a complicated source characterized by two patches of slip in a past study. We numerically solved the equations for a linear dispersive wave on a spherical coordinate system from the initial tsunami height distribution derived from the CMT solution and a classical scaling law for earthquake faults. The tsunami simulations well explain the observed tsunami arrival times, polarities of initial wave, and maximum amplitudes obtained by deep-ocean pressure measurements. The comparison of the simulation results from dispersive and non-dispersive modeling indicates that the dispersive modeling reproduced the observed waveforms better than the conventional non-dispersive approach. Also, the area affected by a maximum height greater than 0.4 m is decreased by approximately 34% by using dispersion modeling. Those results indicate that the tsunami prediction based on CMT solutions is useful for early warning, and the modeling of dispersion can significantly improve performance.},

While recent studies have suggested that such a collapse would likely result in more moderate tsunami waves than originally thought, these would still cause devas-tating effects in the near-field on neighboring Canary Islands, and their far-field coastal hazard would still be significant at some locations, and hence ought to be assessed. Abadie et al. (2011) simulated landslide tsunami generation from various CVV flank collapse scenarios, using a 3D Navier-Stokes (NS) multi-fluid VOF model (THETIS) with implicit slide motion. As 3D-NS computations are both too computationally de-manding and affected by numerical diffusion, they computed near-field impact in a coupled long-wave Boussinesq model (FUNWAVE-TVD). Here, for a similar series of CVV flank collapse scenarios (with 20, 40, 80, and 450 km 3 volume), we further simulate and analyze the near-field tsunami impact, and compute far-field propagation and coastal im-pact at distant locations (such as North America, western Europe and west Africa). A similar one-way model coupling approach is used be-tween THETIS and a Cartesian, fully nonlinear version of FUNWAVE-TVD to compute near-field effects in a fine regional grid (about 15" arc mesh). Results in the latter grid are then used to initialize an ocean basin-scale grid (2' arc mesh) and compute far-field tsunami propagation, using a weakly nonlinear spherical coordinate version of FUNWAVE-TVD. Coastal impact is finally computed in selected locations using more finely resolved nested coastal grids (30" arc mesh). Results are analyzed in terms of wave/tsunami source characteristics, propagation features, and maximum wave elevation off distant coasts. For the most impacted coastal areas, further simulations will be performed in even finer nested grids, to compute inundation and runup. These results will be presented at the conference.},

   abstract = {One class of surface water models is the shallow water models obtained by depth-averaging the microscale mass and momentum balances. Application of shallow water models to large scale problems (on the order of 1000's of km) requires the use of spherical coordinates. Traditionally, balance laws in spherical coordinates are derived by simply expanding the spatial operators in the standard depth-averaged equations. However, the equations themselves are based on an assumed planar surface so that an inconsistency exists between the derivation and the interpretation. In this article, a method is presented that properly accounts for the curvature of the Earth during the depth-averaging procedure. The derivation gives rise to new terms in both the continuity and momentum balances, terms that we refer to as curvature terms. A scaling analysis evaluates the magnitude of the terms. It is shown that the curvature term in the continuity balance is insignificant when the vertical velocity is small, i.e., at least four orders of magnitude less than lateral components. Similarly, when the vertical velocity is small, the curvature term in the momentum balance that comes from the convective terms is insignificant. The second curvature term in the momentum balance is associated with the macroscopic stress tensor; it is on the same order of magnitude as other stress terms and should be retained when momentum dissipation is modeled. Finite element discretization of the resulting balance laws utilizes the generalized wave continuity equation which, because of its monotonie dispersion relation, eliminates noise in the solution without resorting to artificial damping. A cartographic mapping simplifies finite element implementation in spherical coordinates so that Cartesian master elements can be used. Finally, an application to the Western North Atlantic and Gulf of Mexico illustrates the importance of using equations in spherical coordinates for large scale applications.},

   abstract = {The shallow water equations in spherical geometry provide a first prototype for developing and testing numerical algorithms for atmospheric circulation models. Since the seventies these models are often solved with spectral methods. Increasing demands on grid resolution combined with massive parallelism and local grid refinement seem to offer significantly better perspectives for gridpoint methods. In this paper we study the use of Osher's finite-volume scheme for the spatial discretization of the shallow water equations on the rotating sphere. This high-order finite volume scheme of upwind type is well suited to solve a hyperbolic system of equations. Special attention is paid to the pole problem. To that end Osher's scheme is applied on the common (reduced) latitude-longitude grid and on a stereographic grid. The latter is most appropriate in the polar region as in stereographic coordinates the pole singularity does not exist. The latitude-longitude grid is preferred on lower latitudes. Therefore, across the sphere we apply Osher's scheme on a combined grid connecting the two grids at high latitude. We will show that this provides an attractive spatial discretization for explicit integration methods, as it can greatly reduce the time step limitation incurred by the pole singularity when using a latitude-longitude grid only. When time step limitation plays no significant role, the standard (reduced) latitude-longitude grid is advocated provided that the grid is kept sufficiently fine in the polar region to resolve flow over the poles.},

   abstract = {For dynamic distributed systems modeled by partial differential equations, existing methods of sensor location in parameter estimation experiments are either limited to one-dimensional spatial domains or require large investments in software systems. With the expense of scanning and moving sensors, optimal placement presents a critical problem. Optimal Measurement Methods for Distributed Parameter System Identification discusses the characteristic features of the sensor placement problem, analyzes classical and recent approaches, and proposes a wide range of original solutions, culminating in the most comprehensive and timely treatment of the issue available. By presenting a step-by-step guide to theoretical aspects and to practical design methods, this book provides a sound understanding of sensor location techniques. Both researchers and practitioners will find the case studies, the proposed algorithms, and the numerical examples to be invaluable. This text also offers results that translate easily to MATLAB and to Maple. Assuming only a basic familiarity with partial differential equations, vector spaces, and probability and statistics, and avoiding too many technicalities, this is a superb resource for researchers and practitioners in the fields of applied mathematics, electrical, civil, geotechnical, mechanical, chemical, and environmental engineering.},

   abstract = {Falling Liquid Films gives a detailed review of state-of-the-art theoretical, analytical and numerical methodologies, for the analysis of dissipative wave dynamics and pattern formation on the surface of a film falling down a planar inclined substrate. This prototype is an open-flow hydrodynamic instability, that represents an excellent paradigm for the study of complexity in active nonlinear media with energy supply, dissipation and dispersion. It will also be of use for a more general understanding of specific events characterizing the transition to spatio-temporal chaos and weak/dissipative turbulence. Particular emphasis is given to low-dimensional approximations for such flows through a hierarchy of modeling approaches, including equations of the boundary-layer type, averaged formulations based on weighted residuals approaches and long-wave expansions. Whenever possible the link between theory and experiment is illustrated, and, as a further bridge between the two, the development of order-of-magnitude estimates and scaling arguments is used to facilitate the understanding of basic, underlying physics. This monograph will appeal to advanced graduate students in applied mathematics, science or engineering undertaking research on interfacial fluid mechanics or studying fluid mechanics as part of their program. It will also be of use to researchers working on both applied, fundamental theoretical and experimental aspects of thin film flows, as well as engineers and technologists dealing with processes involving isothermal or heated films. This monograph is largely self-contained and no background on interfacial fluid mechanics is assumed.},

We also scrutinize the influence of Reynolds, Prandtl and Marangoni numbers on the shape, speed, flow patterns and temperature distributions for the solitary waves obtained from the regularized model. The hydrodynamic and Marangoni instabilities are seen to reinforce each other in a non-trivial manner. The transport of heat by the flow has a stabilizing effect for small-amplitude waves but promotes the instability for large-amplitude waves when a recirculating zone is present. Nevertheless, in this last case, by increasing the shear in the bulk and thus the viscous dissipation, increasing the Prandtl number decreases the amplitude and speed of the waves.},

The two-dimensional formulation has been extended to account for three-dimensional flows as well. The full second-order two-dimensional model can be expressed as a set of four coupled evolution equations for four slowly varying fields, the thickness h, the flow rate q and two other quantities measuring the departure from the flat-film semi-parabolic velocity profile. A simplified model has been obtained in terms of h and q only. Including viscous dispersion effects properly, it closely sticks to the asymptotic expansion in the appropriate limit. Our new models improve over previous ones in that they remain valid deep into the strongly nonlinear regime, as shown by the comparison of our results relative to travelling-wave and solitary-wave solutions with those of both direct numerical simulations and experiments.},

The standard paradigm for the design and analysis of computer experiments is to employ Gaussian random fields to model computer simulators. Gaussian process models are trained on input-output data obtained from simulation runs at various input values. Following this approach, we propose a sequential design algorithm MICE (mutual information for computer experiments) that adaptively selects the input values at which to run the computer simulator in order to maximize the expected information gain (mutual information) over the input space. The superior computational efficiency of the MICE algorithm compared to other algorithms is demonstrated by test functions and by a tsunami simulator with overall gains of up to 20% in that case.},

Severe shaking by the earthquake collapsed buildings throughout the region and caused 514 fatalities. The tsunami resulted in three casualties and a representative maximum runup height of ~7 m in the near field. The first real-time tsunami data available came from a deep-ocean tsunami detection buoy within 1 hour of tsunami generation. These tsunami data were used to produce initial experimental forecasts within 2 hours of tsunami generation. The far-field forecasts indicated that the tsunami would not flood any of the 14 U.S. communities. Comparison with real-time tide gage data showed very accurate forecasts.},

Feller, in Proceedings of the Second Berkeley Symposium on Mathematical Statistics and Probability (University of California Press, Berkeley and Los Angeles, 1951), pp. 227-246]. This diffusion equation and its generalizations play an important role in many scientific problems, including, physics, biology, finance, and probability theory. We work under the assumption that the fundamental solution represents a probability density and should account for all of the probability in the problem. Thus, under the circumstances where the random process can be irreversibly absorbed at the boundary, this should lead to the presence of a Dirac delta function in the fundamental solution at the boundary. However, such a feature is not present in the standard approach (Laplace transformation). Here we require that the total integrated probability is conserved. This yields a fundamental solution which, when appropriate, contains a term proportional to a Dirac delta function at the boundary. We determine the fundamental solution directly from the diffusion equation via spectral decomposition. We obtain exact expressions for the eigenfunctions, and when the fundamental solution contains a Dirac delta function at the boundary, every eigenfunction of the forward diffusion operator contains a delta function. We show how these combine to produce a weight of the delta function at the boundary which ensures the total integrated probability is conserved. The solution we present covers cases where parameters are time dependent, thereby greatly extending its applicability.},

   abstract = {The coastal states and territories of the United States (US) are vulnerable to devastating tsunamis from near-field or far-field coseismic and underwater/subaerial landslide sources. Following the catastrophic 2004 Indian Ocean tsunami, the National Tsunami Hazard Mitigation Program (NTHMP) accelerated the development of public safety products for the mitigation of these hazards. In response to this initiative, US coastal states and territories speeded up the process of developing/enhancing/adopting tsunami models that can be used for developing inundation maps and evacuation plans. One of NTHMP’s requirements is that all operational and inundation-based numerical (O&I) models used for such purposes be properly validated against established standards to ensure the reliability of tsunami inundation maps as well as to achieve a basic level of consistency between parallel efforts. The validation of several O&I models was considered during a workshop held in 2011 at Texas A&M University (Galveston). This validation was performed based on the existing standard (OAR-PMEL-135), which provides a list of benchmark problems (BPs) covering various tsunami processes that models must meet to be deemed acceptable. Here, we summarize key approaches followed, results, and conclusions of the workshop. Eight distinct tsunami models were validated and cross-compared by using a subset of the BPs listed in the OAR-PMEL-135 standard. Of the several BPs available, only two based on laboratory experiments are detailed here for sake of brevity; since they are considered as sufficiently comprehensive. Average relative errors associated with expected parameters values such as maximum surface amplitude/runup are estimated. The level of agreement with the reference data, reasons for discrepancies between model results, and some of the limitations are discussed. In general, dispersive models were found to perform better than nondispersive models, but differences were relatively small, in part because the BPs mostly featured long waves, such as solitary waves. The largest error found (e.g., the laboratory experiment case of a solitary wave on a simple beach) was 10 % for non-breaking wave conditions and 12 % for breaking conditions; these errors are equal or smaller than the thresholds (10 % and 20 %, respectively) defined by the OAR-PMEL-135 for predicting the surface profile; hence, all models examined here are deemed acceptable for inundation mapping purposes.},

We found an atmospheric disturbance traveling toward 30° (NNE) with amplitude of 2-3 hPa and propagation speed of about 16 m/s, passing through few tens of kilometers wide pathway over the region affected by the tsunami. This disturbance occurred in the lower troposphere, but it was capped by instable convective cell that preserved gravity disturbance's coherence over a region at least 150 km long. An ocean modeling study showed that such a disturbance is capable of generating large tsunami waves and strong currents over the shallow regions, following the observations over the region where maximum sea level oscillations have been documented. Therefore, this event has a potential to be classified as a meteotsunami, the first of such kind in the Black Sea.},

An intriguing aspect of this tsunami is the delayed arrival of a destructive wave, larger than the initial wave, at Talcahuano harbour three hours after the initial earthquake shock. The 2010 Chile tsunami has been modelled using H2Ocean tsunami model using Moreno’s, Delouis’ and Vigny’s earthquake solutions. Each earthquake model produces realistic tsunami wave fields and predicts the large wave which severally flooded the Bay of Concepción. Numerical simulations also show persistent sea surface oscillations for several hours. The computed surface elevations have been processed to compute the energy flux. The energy flux shows the presence and the important role of edge waves during this event. It shows that constructive wave interference of two edge waves over the submarine canyon nearby Cobquecura leads to the large wave which destroyed Talcahuano harbour.},

   abstract = {Great differences in hazard and losses were shown from two tsunamis, both generated in Chile, one in 1960 and the other in 2010. Numerical simulation was applied to the tsunami analysis. The fault dislocation of the seafloor was assumed to equal to the initial tsunami wave field, which can be calculated by the formula of fault dislocation in the elastic isotropic half-space. The linear long wave theory was used as the tsunami hydrodynamic model, and the finite difference method and leap-frog scheme were selected for solving the equations. The accuracy of the simulated results was verified by the observed data in five tide gauges. By means of two scenario tsunamis, the analytical results show that the earthquake magnitude, bathymetry in rupture zone and rapid release of warning information in 2010 tsunami are the main explanations of the aforementioned great difference.},

   abstract = {The shallow depth underthrust earthquake of February 27, 2010 (Mw 8.8) ruptured the subduction plate interface in central Chile between 34°S and 38°S. We retrieve the spatial and temporal distribution of slip during this mega-earthquake through a joint inversion of teleseismic records, InSAR and High Rate GPS (HRGPS) data. Additionally, our model is shown to agree with broadband surface waves. Rupture initiated at about 32 km depth and propagated bilaterally resulting in two main slip zones located SSW and NNE of the hypocenter. Nucleation did not take place within or at the edge of one of these main asperities, but in between. During the first 30s, slip propagated predominantly southwards. Later on, the rupture evolved more slowly and more symmetrically. Eventually, the northern asperity became predominant with maximum slip reaching about 20 m. Most of the seismic moment was released within 110s, a relatively short time, explained by the bilateral propagation. The overall average rupture velocity is 2.6 km/s but propagation occurred initially faster towards the south (3.2 km/s). Large slip did not reach the trench, a result consistent with the moderate size of the tsunami. Down-dip, rupture stopped at about 50 km depth, in agreement with the lower limit of the locked zone inferred by Ruegg et al. (2009) from pre-seismic GPS data.},

We vary such parameters of the source as rupture depth, dipangle and rake-angle. Some variations in magnitude and strike angle are considered. The fully nonlinear dispersive model on a rotating sphere is used for wave propagation simulations. The main feature of the algorithm is the splitting of initial system on two subproblems of elliptic and hyperbolic type, which allows implementation of well-suitable numerical methods for them. The dispersive effects are estimated through differences between computations with the dispersive and nondispersive models. We consider an idealized test with a constant depth, a model basin for near-field tsunami simulations and a realistic scenario. Our computations show that the dispersion effects are strongly sensitive to the rupture depth and the dip-angle variations. Waves generated by sources with lager magnitude may be even more affected by dispersion.},

We employ a semi-implicit approach that couples the moving mesh equation to an efficient, explicit solver for the physical PDE, with the resulting scheme behaving in practice as a two-step predictor-corrector method.

   abstract = {In this paper we describe a one-dimensional adaptive moving mesh method and its application to hyperbolic conservation laws from magnetohydrodynamics (MHD). The method is robust, because it employs automatic control of mesh adaptation when a new model is considered, without manually-set parameters. Adaptive meshes are a common tool for increasing the accuracy and reducing computational costs when solving time-dependent partial differential equations (PDEs). Mesh points are moved towards locations where they are needed the most. To obtain a time-dependent adaptive mesh, monitor functions are used to automatically ‘monitor’ the importance of the various parts of the domain, by assigning a ‘weight’-value to each location. Based on the equidistribution principle, all mesh points are distributed according to their assigned weights. We use a sophisticated monitor function that tracks both small, local phenomena as well as large shocks in the same solution. The combination of the moving mesh method and a high-resolution finite volume solver for hyperbolic PDEs yields a serious gain in accuracy at relatively no extra costs. The results of several numerical experiments including comparisons with h-refinement are presented, which cover many intriguing aspects typifying nonlinear magnetofluid dynamics, with higher accuracy than often seen in similar publications.},

The mesh is obtained by taking the gradient of a (scalar) mesh potential function which satisfies an appropriate nonlinear parabolic partial differential equation. This method gives a new technique for performing r-adaptivity based on ideas from optimal transportation combined with the equidistribution principle applied to a (time-varying) scalar monitor function (used successfully in moving mesh methods in one-dimension). Detailed analysis of this new method is presented in which the convergence, regularity, and stability of the mesh is studied. Additionally, this new method is shown to be straightforward to program and implement, requiring the solution of only one simple scalar time-dependent equation in arbitrary dimension, with adaptivity along the boundaries handled automatically. We discuss three preexisting methods in the context of this work. Examples are presented in which either the monitor function is prescribed in advance, or it is given by the solution of a partial differential equation.},

   abstract = {This book is an introduction to structured and unstructured grid methods in scientific computing, addressing graduate students, scientists as well as practitioners. Basic local and integral grid quality measures are formulated and new approaches to mesh generation are reviewed. In addition to the content of the successful first edition, a more detailed and practice oriented description of monitor metrics in Beltrami and diffusion equations is given for generating adaptive numerical grids. Also, new techniques developed by the author are presented, in particular a technique based on the inverted form of Beltrami’s partial differential equations with respect to control metrics. This technique allows the generation of adaptive grids for a wide variety of computational physics problems, including grid clustering to given function values and gradients, grid alignment with given vector fields, and combinations thereof. Applications of geometric methods to the analysis of numerical grid behavior as well as grid generation based on the minimization of functionals of smoothness, conformality, orthogonality, energy, and alignment complete the second edition of this outstanding compendium on grid generation methods.},

In the first case, the optimality criterion is based on a measure of independence between the sensor responses, while in the second case, it is based on a measure of independence between the parameter sensitivity functions. The procedure, which is general and can be applied to models with any degree of complexity, is illustrated with the optimal placement of temperature sensors in a catalytic fixed-bed reactor. Some numerical results for the on-line estimation of temperature and concentration profiles as well as for the estimation of unknown model parameters are discussed.},

@article{Sun2005,
   abstract = {Designing an experiment for identifying a distributed parameter is a very challenging problem when the spatial variability of the parameter is unknown. First, we need to determine an appropriate structure complexity for the unknown parameter. A more complicated structure needs more data for identification. Second, we need to evaluate the sufficiency of an experiment design before it is actually conducted. In this paper, the complexity of parameter structure is determined by the accuracy requirement of model application, and the sufficiency of data is evaluated by solving a generalized inverse problem. The worst-case parameter (WCP) defined in this paper is the one that causes the maximum deviation in model application when its structure is simplified. The WCP of a structure can be found by solving a discrete optimization problem with the genetic algorithm. Quantitative relationships between structure complexity, parameter identifiability, data sufficiency and model reliability are derived. For example, it has been proven that if an experimental design is sufficient for identifying the WCP then it must be sufficient for identifying all other parameters with the same structure or simplified structures in the admissible region, and thus, it is a robust design. Based on the theoretical results and algorithms presented in this paper, we may develop a cost-effective methodology for constructing reliable distributed parameter models.},

Problems associated with estimation of the error in quasi Monte Carlo integration and with the selection of test functions are identified. Then an estimate of the maximum error of the quasi Monte Carlo integration of nine test functions is computed for up to 400 dimensions and is used to evaluate the known generators mentioned above and the two new generators.

The choice of the numerical procedures is justified from a review of the literature. Problems of the wave generation and absorption are investigated. The present method operates in the physical space and applications to four different wave problems are presented and discussed (space periodic wave propagation and breaking, solitary wave propagation, run-up and radiation, transient wave generation). Emphasis in the paper is given to describing the numerical methods used in the computation.},

New modules have been further extended to advance the wave generation and wave absorbing capabilities of the code. The numerical results for wave interactions with a vertical surface piercing cylinder have been compared with physical experiments performed at Danish Hydraulic Institute (DHI). Comparisons between the numerical results and the measured data for three regular waves and four focused wave groups, have indicated that OpenFOAM is very capable of accurate modelling of nonlinear wave interaction with offshore structures, with up to 4th order harmonic correctly captured. Moreover, by using the crest-trough phase-based separation method, we can reproduce harmonic structure in the wave loading on the structure and free surface elevations.},

In recent years, numerical models have been further developed and their use is becoming increasingly attractive, such as the Smoothed Particle Hydrodynamics (SPH) numerical models which enable the simulation of complex free surface flows. The SPH numerical model developed at the National Laboratory for Civil Engineering (LNEC) is validated by comparing the numerical results of the wave interaction with a vertical wall using data obtained from physical modeling tests carried out in one of the LNEC׳s flumes. The numerical results presented a good agreement with the physical model tests. The free surface level was well estimated, with a concordance index between numerical results and experimental data of about 90.5-99.1%, presenting an average value of 95.5%. Pressure at the vertical wall shows high intensity and short duration impact loads, and presented a concordance index between numerical results and experimental data about 68.8-94.4%, with an average value about 86.2%. Considering the complex phenomena involved, which is highly difficult to be accurately modeled, numerically and experimentally, a good agreement between physical tests and numerical results was accomplished.},

Linear algebra, complex numbers, differential equations, and Fourier transformation are utilized as bases for the analysis, and each chapter ends with problems. While the book's focus is on linear theory, the practical application of energy storage and transport is interwoven throughout. This book will be appropriate for those with backgrounds in elementary fluid dynamics or hydrodynamics and mathematical analysis.

All error estimates are strictly local. Another result of the paper is a close relationship between finite difference scheme and linear finite element methods combined with a special kind of quadrature.

We show that our long wave model with a critical Bond number admits stable travelling wave solutions with a singular crest. These solutions are usually referred to in the literature as peakons or peaked solitary waves. They satisfy the usual speed-amplitude relation, which coincides with Scott-Russel's empirical formula for solitary waves, while their decay rate is the same regardless their amplitude. Moreover, they can be of depression or elevation type independent of their speed. The dynamics of these solutions are studied as well.},

The first one deals with purely conductive heat transfer. The concept of optimal experiment design is detailed and verified with 100 inverse problems for different experiment designs. The second case study combines a strong coupling between heat and moisture transfer through a porous building material. The methodology presented is based on a scientific formalism for efficient planning of experimental work that can be extended to the optimal design of experiments related to other problems in thermal and fluid sciences.},

The flat vertical plate is fixed on a towing carriage that is set off by suddenly dropping a weight bucket through a connecting steel cable in a pulley system. The free‐surface profile in front of the plate and the pressure distribution on the plate surface are measured for three different accelerations of the plate. A capacitance‐type wave gauge is used to measure the variations of the water surface, while a variable reluctance pressure transducer is used to measure the pressure on the plate surface. The acceleration of the plate is obtained by means of an accelerometer. All response voltage outputs are recorded on an IBM PC‐XT personal computer with a data‐acquisition electrical board. Experimental measurements are compared with the numerical, viscous‐flow results of Yang and Chwang (IIHR Report No. 332; Iowa Institute of Hydraulic Research, The University of Iowa, 1989) and the analytical, inviscid‐flow solution of Chwang [Phys. Fluids 26, 383 (1983)]. The agreement of the free‐surface profile and the pressure distribution between the numerical results and the present experimental measurements is fairly good. However, the inviscid‐flow solution overpredicts the wave amplitude and the pressure distribution on the plate.

The results of velocity and temperature measurements are reported. A numerical model for a liquid film on a structured wall is developed. The full incompressible Navier-Stokes equations and the energy equation are integrated by a finite difference algorithm, whereas the mobile gas-liquid interface is tracked by the volume-of-fluid method. The numerical model is verified by comparison with the experimental data showing a good agreement. The model is used to study flow patterns and film rupture caused by the thermocapillary forces. Heat transfer in the liquid is also investigated. In particular, it is found that the thermocapillary convection enhances heat transfer in liquid, though the effect depends on the shape of the wall surface.},

   abstract = {A comprehensive description is obtained of the two-dimensional steady gravity-driven flow with prescribed volume flux of a thin film of Newtonian fluid with temperature-dependent viscosity on a stationary horizontal cylinder. When the cylinder is uniformly hotter than the surrounding atmosphere (positive thermoviscosity), the effect of increasing the heat transfer to the surrounding atmosphere at the free surface is to increase the average viscosity and hence reduce the average velocity within the film, with the net effect that the film thickness (and hence the total fluid load on the cylinder) is increased to maintain the fixed volume flux of fluid. When the cylinder is uniformly colder than the surrounding atmosphere (negative thermoviscosity), the opposite occurs. Increasing the heat transfer at the free surface from weak to strong changes the film thickness everywhere (and hence the load, but not the temperature or the velocity) by a constant factor which depends only on the specific viscosity model considered. The effect of increasing the thermoviscosity is always to increase the film thickness and hence the load. In the limit of strong positive thermoviscosity, the velocity is small and uniform outside a narrow boundary layer near the cylinder leading to a large film thickness, while in the limit of strong negative thermoviscosity, the velocity increases from zero at the cylinder to a large value at the free surface leading to a small film thickness.},

We use the thin-layer approximation in conjunction with the Karman-Polhausen method to derive evolution equations for the film thickness and the volumetric flow rates in the radial and azimuthal directions. We also use the integral balance method to derive evolution equations for the thickness of the diffusion boundary layer as well as the concentration of solute at the disk surface. Numerical solutions of these partial differential equations, which govern the hydrodynamics and the associated mass transfer, reveal the formation of large finite-amplitude waves and elucidate their significant effect on the mass-transfer characteristics. We illustrate this dependence quantitatively by examining the effect of system parameters on the time-averaged and spatially averaged Sherwood numbers. The results are assessed by comparison with computations of the parabolized convective diffusion equation and experimental data.},

In this paper a model describing Marangoni convection, interface dynamics and evaporation in liquid films on composite substrates or substrates of functionally graded materials is developed. Non-uniform thermal conductivity of the substrate causes non-uniformity of temperature distribution at the liquid-gas interface which leads to appearance of Marangoni stresses, convective vortices and film deformation. The film dynamics is described in the framework of long-wave theory. The substrate thermal conductivity non-uniformity has a pronounced effect on transport processes in the liquid film.},

The incline is maintained at a uniform temperature which exceeds the temperature of the ambient gas above the fluid and is thus responsible for heating the thin fluid layer. The variable fluid properties are allowed to vary linearly with temperature. It is assumed that long-wave perturbations are most unstable. Based on this, a stability analysis was carried out whereby the governing linearized perturbation equations were expanded in powers of the wavenumber which is a small parameter.

Particular attention is paid to the development of dryout. We derive long-wave evolution equations for the interface shapes that govern the two-dimensional nonlinear stability of the layers subject to the above coupled mechanisms. These equations are analysed and their predictions discussed. Previous theoretical and experimental results are reviewed and compared with the present results.

The basic approach is to decouple the determination of the moving grid from the solution of the differential equation on the moving grid. The grid is determined by an elliptic grid generation technique suitably modified for time-accurate computations. Two methods, Godunov's scheme and an artificial viscosity method, are used to discretize the differential equation. The technique is applied to problems involving the Buckley-Leverett equation modelling the flow of two immiscible fluids in a porous medium. Substantial improvement in computational efficiency is obtained by using the adaptive grid technique. Extensions of this approach to several space dimensions and systems of equations are discussed.},

An interesting example of such a method is provided by the moving-finite-element (MFE) method. A difficulty with MFE, as with many other existing moving-grid methods, is the threat of grid distortion, which can only be avoided by the use of penalty terms. The involved parameter tuning is known to be very important, not only to provide for a safe automatic grid-point selection, but also for efficiency in the time-stepping process. When compared with MFE, the gradient-weighted MFE (GWMFE) method has some promising properties to reduce the need of tuning. To investigate to what extent GWM FE can be called robust, reliable, and effective for the automatic solution of time-dependent PDEs in one space dimension, we have tested this method extensively on a set of five relevant example problems with various solution characteristics. All tests have been carried out using the BDF time integrator SPGEAR of the existing method-of-lines software package SPRINT.},

It is shown that, under periodic boundary conditions, the formula is supraconvergent in the sense that, in spite of being inconsistent, it gives rise to schemes with second-order convergence. However, such a supraconvergence only takes place when the number of points in the grid is odd: for grids with an even number of points the inconsistency of the formula results in lack of convergence.

   abstract = {It is now clear that the 2011 Tohoku-Oki earthquake ruptured the subduction interface all the way to the Japan Trench. However, there is significant disagreement about just how much slip occurred at the trench, with most geodetic studies locating only a small fraction of the maximum slip there, whereas broadband seismic studies put the majority of the slip near the trench. Measurements of seafloor displacement near the trench also imply more slip there than is estimated by the geodetic studies. Here, by means of a joint inversion of displacement measurements and seafloor pressure data, we show that it is possible to reconcile geodetic and seismic studies and that a considerable amount of slip indeed occurred at the trench, with slip magnitudes reaching 57–74% of the maximum slip. The seafloor displacement predicted by our model agrees very well with independent measurements made close to the trench. We also find good agreement between our tsunami model and independent measurements of tsunami height in the ocean and on land. Re-running of the inversion without the near-field pressure gauge data, however, leads to underprediction of the flooding on land, even when the seafloor geodetic data are still included. Thus, even if the seafloor geodetic measurements had been available in real time, they would still not have allowed reliable prediction of near-field tsunami inundation. Close to the trench, the dip of the plate interface is shallow, which serves to decrease the vertical motion of the sea floor for any given slip. However, the horizontal motion is conversely larger. Because the ocean floor slopes steeply near the trench, it acted like a giant wedge, converting the horizontal motion of the ground into an uplift of the water column and causing the peak initial tsunami wave height to be twice as high as it would have been from vertical displacement alone.},

Wavelet analysis of the wave elevation reveals that the high frequency components of the 2004 Sumatra tsunami were markedly dispersive. The observed dispersion was found to be in a good agreement with theoretical estimates of the dispersion derived from the group velocity of the waves. The results of this analysis demonstrate the importance of wave dispersion for tsunami wave propagation and transformation and indicate the necessity to take into consideration this factor in numerical simulations of tsunami waves.},

On the basis of far-field analyses and heuristic arguments, we show that the traveling wave solutions of this equation are weakly non-local solitary waves characterized by small amplitude fast oscillations in the far-field. We review various analytical and numerical methods originally devised to obtain this type of weakly non-local solitary wave solutions of the singularly perturbed (fifth-order) KdV equation.

   abstract = {Dissipationless hydrodynamics regularized by dispersion describe a number of physical media including water waves, nonlinear optics, and Bose-Einstein condensates. As in the classical theory of hyperbolic equations where a non-convex flux leads to non-classical solution structures, a non-convex linear dispersion relation provides an intriguing dispersive hydrodynamic analogue. Here, the fifth order Korteweg-de Vries (KdV) equation, also known as the Kawahara equation, a classical model for shallow water waves, is shown to be a universal model of Eulerian hydrodynamics with higher order dispersive effects. Utilizing asymptotic methods and numerical computations, this work classifies the long-time behavior of solutions for step-like initial data. For convex dispersion, the result is a dispersive shock wave (DSW), qualitatively and quantitatively bearing close resemblance to the KdV DSW. For non-convex dispersion, three distinct dynamic regimes are observed. For small jumps, a perturbed KdV DSW with positive polarity and orientation is generated, accompanied by small amplitude radiation from an embedded solitary wave leading edge, termed a radiating DSW or RDSW. For moderate jumps, a crossover regime is observed with waves propagating forward and backward from the sharp transition region. For jumps exceeding a critical threshold, a new type of DSW is observed we term a translating DSW or TDSW. The TDSW consists of a traveling wave that connects a partial, non-monotonic, negative solitary wave at the trailing edge to an interior nonlinear periodic wave. Its speed, a generalized Rankine-Hugoniot jump condition, is determined by the far-field structure of the traveling wave. The TDSW is resolved at the leading edge by a harmonic wavepacket moving with the linear group velocity. The non-classical TDSW exhibits features common to both dissipative and dispersive shock waves.},

   abstract = {Stokes’ infinitesimal-wave expansion for steady progressive free-surface waves has been extended to high order using a computer to perform the coefficient arithmetic. Stokes’ expansion has been found to be incapable of yielding the highest wave for any value of the water depth since convergence is limited by a square-root branch-point some distance short of the maximum. By reformulating the problem using a different independent parameter, the highest waves are obtained correctly. Series summation and analytic continuation are facilitated by the use of Padé approximants. The method is valid in principle for any finite value of the wavelength and solutions of high accuracy can be obtained for most values of the wave height and water depth. An alternative expansion procedure proposed by Havelock for the computation of waves short of the highest has been reconsidered and found to be defective.},

   abstract = {Ghosts are a new class of approximate solutions to nonlinear boundary-value problems (BVPs). They are bounded away from true solutions, but solve an initial-value problem (IVP) for the differential equations exactly, and approximate boundary and internal matching conditions with exponentially decaying error as a control parameter approaches infinity. Ghosts are characteristic of singularly perturbed differential equations in which solutions are localized and the IVP depends sensitively on initial data. They correspond to shifted, localized solutions and they can be observed in (imperfect) physical experiments and be approximated by convergent discretization schemes. The latter property suggests that the concept of the ‘numerically irrelevant’ solution, introduced for discretized second-order BVPs, should be re-examined.},

In connection with the problem of the process of the chemical reaction in a detonation wave, the objections raised against the conceptions of Le Chatelier and Vieille of the 19th century with regard to the ignition of the gas by the shock wave are refuted. On the basis of this concept, it is possible to give a rigorous foundation for the existing method of computing the detonation velocity. The distributions of the temperature, the pressure, and the velocity in the detonation wave front as the chemical reaction proceeds, are considered. On the assumption of the absence of losses, the pure compression of the gas in the shock wave at the start of the chemical reaction develops a temperature that is near the temperature of combustion of the given mixture at constant pressure.},

In the 1960s, researchers developed effective asymptotic methods for deriving nonlinear wave equations, such as the KdV equation, governing a broad class of physical phenomena that admit special solutions including those commonly known as solitons. This book describes the underlying approximation techniques and methods for finding solutions to these and other equations. The concepts and methods covered include wave dispersion, asymptotic analysis, perturbation theory, the method of multiple scales, deep and shallow water waves, nonlinear optics including fiber optic communications, mode-locked lasers and dispersion-managed wave phenomena. Most chapters feature exercise sets, making the book suitable for advanced courses or for self-directed learning. Graduate students and researchers will find this an excellent entry to a thriving area at the intersection of applied mathematics, engineering and physical science.},

In other cases the wave amplitude decreases as the wave propagates, but since the essential balance is between nonlinear steepening and frequency dispersion we feel justified in using the adjective ‘solitary’ to describe them though they violate the clessical description of such waves. can be produced by allowing a region of mixed fluid, with a potential energy greater than its surroundings, to collapse towards its equilibrium state. The number of waves and their amplitude depend on the properties of the mixed region and of the ambient stratification. Three different geometrical configurations have been chosen and while each gives qualitatively the same results the form taken by the generated waves and the final equilibrium shape of the mixed region depend critically on these geometrical factors. We relate the internal waves produced by this mechanism to waves produced in natural systems and show that our observations support at least one possible explanation for those found in the oceans and planetary atmospheres.},

   abstract = {The theory of blood circulation is the oldest and most advanced branch of biomechanics, with roots extending back to Huangti and Aristotle, and with contributions from Galileo, Santori, Descartes, Borelli, Harvey, Euler, Hales, Poiseuille, Helmholtz, and many others. It represents a major part of humanity's concept of itself. This book presents selected topics of this great body of ideas from a historical perspective, binding important experiments together with mathematical threads. The objectives and scope of this book remain the same as in the first edition: to present a treatment of circulatory biomechanics from the stand­ points of engineering, physiology, and medical science, and to develop the subject through a sequence of problems and examples. The name is changed from Biodynamics: Circulation to Biomechanics: Circulation to unify the book with its sister volumes, Biomechanics: Mechanical Properties of Living Tissues, and Biomechanics: Motion, Flow, Stress, and Growth. The major changes made in the new edition are the following: When the first edition went to press in 1984, the question of residual stress in the heart was raised for the first time, and the lung was the only organ analyzed on the basis of solid morphologic data and constitutive equations. The detailed analysis of blood flow in the lung had been done, but the physiological validation experiments had not yet been completed.},

In this method, we extended the Numerov Scheme to the singularly perturbed two-point boundary value problem with first order derivative. By using non symmetric finite differences and mixed finite difference for the first order derivative, the finite difference scheme is derived. An exponential fitting factor is introduced in this finite difference scheme which takes care of the rapid behaviour occurs in the boundary layers. Using the asymptotic approximate solution of singular perturbations, the fitting factor is derived. Discrete invariant imbedding algorithm is used to solve the tridiagonal system of the fitted finite difference method. The method is analyzed for convergence. Numerical experiments are presented to demonstrate the utility and efficiency of the proposed computational method.},

   abstract = {Implicit schemes require important sub-iterations when dealing with highly nonlinear problems such as the combined heat and moisture transfer through porous building elements. The computational cost rises significantly when the whole-building is simulated, especially when there is important coupling among the building elements themselves with neighbouring zones and with HVAC (heating ventilation and air conditioning) systems. On the other hand, the classical Euler explicit scheme is generally not used because its stability condition imposes very fine time discretisation. Hence, this paper explores the use of an improved explicit approach - the DuFort-Frankel scheme - to overcome the disadvantage of the classical explicit one and to bring benefits that cannot be obtained by implicit methods. The DuFort-Frankel approach is first compared to the classical Euler implicit and explicit schemes to compute the solution of nonlinear heat and moisture transfer through porous materials. Then, the analysis of the DuFort-Frankel unconditionally stable explicit scheme is extended to the coupled heat and moisture balances on the scale of a one- and a two-zone building models. The DuFort-Frankel scheme has the benefits of being unconditionally stable, second-order accurate in time O(dt^2) and to compute explicitly the solution at each time step, avoiding costly sub-iterations. This approach may reduce the computational cost by twenty as well as it may enable perfect synchronism for whole-building simulation and co-simulation.},

@article{Mendes2004,
   abstract = {Many phenomena present in nature are complex to study because of the strong natural coupling of their physical variables. For example, conservation equations in heat transfer problems are frequently coupled. Classical solution methods are based on numerical decoupling: cross terms at a given iteration step are calculated by using the values of the potentials previously calculated. This procedure increases the magnitude of source terms with respect to the main diagonal terms and requires very small time steps to ensure numerical stability. This article presents a generic multitridiagonal-matrix algorithm (MTDMA) to simultaneously solve the heat and mass transfer governing equations in porous media, with strong coupling among the dependent variables. It is shown that, in addition to considerably reducing the running time, it assures stable solutions for much higher time steps. To verify its performance, a combined heat and mass transfer problem through a porous medium is presented and comparisons with the TriDiagonal-Matrix Algorithm (TDMA) are made in terms of numerical stability and computer run time. The algorithm has shown itself to be a very effective solver for applications where two or more set of linear equations are strongly coupled.},

   abstract = {The terms “inverse problems” and “ill-posed problems” have been steadily and surely gaining popularity in modern science since the middle of the 20th century. A little more than fifty years of studying problems of this kind have shown that a great number of problems from various branches of classical mathematics (computational algebra, differential and integral equations, partial differential equations, functional analysis) can be classified as inverse or ill-posed, and they are among the most complicated ones (since they are unstable and usually nonlinear). At the same time, inverse and ill-posed problems began to be studied and applied systematically in physics, geophysics, medicine, astronomy, and all other areas of knowledge where mathematical methods are used. The reason is that solutions to inverse problems describe important properties of media under study, such as density and velocity of wave propagation, elasticity parameters, conductivity, dielectric permittivity and magnetic permeability, and properties and location of inhomogeneities in inaccessible areas, etc.},

It is the intent that this modification to the nonlinear flux terms will result in an inviscid regularization of the homentropic Euler equations and Euler equations. The physical motivation for this technique is presented and a general method is derived, which is then applied to the homentropic Euler equations and Euler equations. These modified equations are then examined, revealing that they share conservative properties, shock speeds, and traveling wave solutions with the original equations. If compactness of the solutions is assumed, then it can be proven that as the averaging is diminished the solutions converge to weak solutions of the original equations. Finally, numerical simulations are conducted showing that the modified equations appear regularized and converge to the entropy solution in shock tube simulations.},

It highlights the significant role these currents play within the global sediment cycle, and their importance in environmental processes and in the formation of hydrocarbon reservoirs. Events and mechanisms governing the initiation of turbidity currents are reviewed, along with experimental observations and findings from field studies regarding their internal velocity and density structure. As turbidity currents propagate over the seafloor, they can trigger the evolution of a host of topographical features through the processes of deposition and erosion, such as channels, levees, and sediment waves. Potential linear instability mechanisms are discussed that may determine the spatial scales of these features. Finally, the hierarchy of available theoretical models for analyzing the dynamics of turbidity currents is outlined, ranging from dimensional analysis and integral models to both depth-averaged and depth-resolving simulation approaches.},

   abstract = {Experimental results for the release of a fixed volume of one homogeneous fluid into another of slightly different density are presented. From these results and those obtained by previous experiments, it is argued that the resulting gravity current can pass through three states. There is first a slumping phase, during which the current is retarded by the counterflow in the fluid into which it is issuing. The current remains in this slumping phase until the depth ratio of current to intruded fluid is reduced to less than about 0.075. This may be followed by a (previously investigated) purely inertial phase, wherein the buoyancy force of the intruding fluid is balanced by the inertial force. Motion in the surrounding fluid plays a negligible role in this phase. There then follows a viscous phase, wherein the buoyancy force is balanced by viscous forces. It is argued and confirmed by experiment that the inertial phase is absent if viscous effects become important before the slumping phase has been completed. Relationships between spreading distance and time for each phase are obtained for all three phases for both two-dimensional and axisymmetric geometries. Some consequences of the retardation of the gravity current during the slumping phase are discussed.},

   abstract = {Direct numerical simulations are performed of gravity-current fronts in the lock-exchange configuration. The case of small density differences is considered, where the Boussinesq approximations can be adopted. The key objective of the investigation is a detailed analysis of the flow structure at the foremost part of the front, where no previous high-resolution data were available. For the simulations, high-order numerical methods are used, based on spectral and spectral-element discretizations and compact finite differences. A three-dimensional simulation is conducted of a front spreading along a no-slip boundary at a Reynolds number of about 750. The simulation exhibits all features typically observed in experimental flows near the gravity-current head, including the lobe-and-cleft structure at the leading edge. The results reveal that the flow topology at the head differs from what has been assumed previously, in that the foremost point is not a stagnation point in a translating system. Rather, the stagnation point is located below and slightly behind the foremost point in the vicinity of the wall. The relevance of this finding for the mechanism behind the lobe-and-cleft instability is discussed. In order to explore the high-Reynolds-number regime, and to assess potential Reynolds-number effects, two-dimensional simulations are conducted for Reynolds numbers up to about 30 000, for both no-slip and slip (i.e. shear-stress free) boundaries. It is shown that although quantitative Reynolds-number effects persist over the whole range examined, no qualitative changes in the flow structure at the head can be observed. A comparison of the two-dimensional results with laboratory data and the three-dimensional simulation provides evidence that a two-dimensional model is able to capture essential features of the flow at the head. The simulations also show that for the free-slip case the shape of the head agrees closely with the classical inviscid theory of Benjamin.},

We present a theoretical study on the dynamics of and deposition from a turbulent current flowing down a uniform planar slope from a constant-flux point source of particle-laden fluid. The flow is modelled using the shallow-water equations, including the effects of bottom friction and entrainment of ambient fluid, coupled to an equation for the transport and settling of the particles. Two flow regimes are identified. Near the source and for mild slopes, the flow is dominated by a balance between buoyancy and bottom friction. Further downstream and for steeper slopes, entrainment also affects the behaviour of the current. Similarity solutions are also developed for the simple cases of homogeneous gravity currents with no settling of particles in the friction-dominated and entrainment-dominated regimes. Estimates of the width and length of the deposit from a monodisperse particle-driven gravity current with settling are derived from scaling analysis for each regime, and the contours of the depositional patterns are determined from numerical solution of the governing equations.},

   abstract = {It is of great concern to produce numerically efficient methods for moisture diffusion through porous media, capable of accurately calculate moisture distribution with a reduced computational effort. In this way, model reduction methods are promising approaches to bring a solution to this issue since they do not degrade the physical model and provide a significant reduction of computational cost. Therefore, this article explores in details the capabilities of two model reduction techniques - the Spectral reduced-order model and the proper generalized decomposition - to numerically solve moisture diffusive transfer through porous materials. Both approaches are applied to three different problems to provide clear examples of the construction and use of these reduced-order models. The methodology of both approaches is explained extensively so that the article can be used as a numerical benchmark by anyone interested in building a reduced-order model for diffusion problems in porous materials. Linear and nonlinear unsteady behaviors of unidimensional moisture diffusion are investigated. The last case focuses on solving a parametric problem in which the solution depends on space, time and the diffusivity properties. Results have highlighted that both methods provide accurate solutions and enable to reduce significantly the order of the model around 10 times lower than the large original model. It also allows an efficient computation of the physical phenomena with an error lower than 10^\{-2\} when compared to a reference solution.},

   abstract = {A new experimental procedure to generate solitary waves in a flume using a piston type wave maker is derived from Rayleigh's (1876, [18]) solitary wave solution. Resulting solitary waves fordimensionless amplitudes £ ranging from 0.05 to 0.5 are as pure as the ones generated using Goring's (1978, [7]) procedure which is based on Boussinesq (1871a, [1]) solitary wave, with trailing waves of amplitude lower than 3 % of the main pulse amplitude. In contrast with Goring's procedure, the new procedure results in very little loss of amplitude in the initial stage of the propagation of the solitary waves. We show that solitary waves generated using this new procedure are more rapidly established. This is attributed to the better description of the outskirts decay coefficient in a solitary wave given by Rayleigh's solution rather than by a Boussinesq expression. Two other generation procedures based on first-order (KdV) and second order shallow water theories are also tested. Solitary waves generated by the latter are of much lower quality than those generated with Rayleigh or Boussinesq-based procedures.},

RM's matrices are identified through the minimisation of a functional build on the discrepancy between DM's and RM's responses, for several values of Rayleigh number.

This method derives from the Modal Identification Method developed for linear systems in previous works. Starting from a Detailed Model (DM) under matrix form, a RM structure is defined. RM’s matrices are then identified through the minimization of a squared residues functional built with the discrepancy between system responses (DM outputs in this study) on the one hand and RM outputs on the other hand, when a specific input signal is applied. A tridimensional example with thermal conductivity depending linearly on temperature illustrates the method. In comparison with DM, computing time is drastically reduced (division by a factor greater than 1000 in the proposed example) without significant loss of accuracy.},

   abstract = {Description of complex materials, in particular complex fluids, involves numerous computational challenges. Today, atomistic descriptions are too expensive from the computational point of view, motivating that this kind of analysis is restricted to extremely small systems. The next scale introduces some simplificative hypotheses, leading to coarse grained descriptions. At this level, Brownian dynamics simulations are usually employed. However, this level of description requires intensive computation resources with significant unfavorable impact on the simulation performances (CPU time). For these reasons sometimes kinetic theory descriptions are preferred. In those de- scriptions, the molecular conformation is described from a probability distribution function (PDF) whose evolution is governed by the Fokker-Planck equation. This approach, despite its mathematical simplicity introduces some computational challenges. First, the distribution function is defined in a multidimensional space, and then the associated partial differential equations must be solved in a multidimensional domain (some times involving thousands dimensions). Secondly, the analysis of transient models needs intensive computation, in particular when the system response under small amplitude oscillations (of high and very high frequency) is concerned. In some of our former works we proposed a technique based on the separated representation of the unknown field able to circumvent the curse of dimensionality. In this paper, we are addressing the second chal- lenging point, the one related to the transient behavior. For this purpose we propose a separated representation of transient models leading to a non-incremental strategy, allowing impressive CPU time savings.},

   abstract = {Nonlinear evolution of long-crested wave groups can lead to extreme interactions with coastal and marine structures. In the present study the role of nonlinear evolution in the formation of extreme run-up events on a vertical wall is investigated. To this end, the fundamental problem of interaction between non-breaking water waves and a vertical wall over constant water depth is considered. In order to simulate nonlinear wave–wall interactions, the high-order spectral method is applied to a computational domain which aims to represent a two-dimensional wave flume. Wave generation is simulated at the flume entrance by means of the additional potential concept. Through this concept, the implementation of a numerical wavemaker is applicable. In addition to computational efficiency, the adopted numerical approach enables one to consider the evolution of nonlinear waves while preserving full dispersivity. Utilizing these properties, the influence of the nonlinear wave evolution on the wave run-up can be examined for a wide range of water depths. In shallow water, it is known that nonlinear evolution of incident waves may result in extreme run-up events due to the formation of an undular bore. The present study reveals the influence of the nonlinear evolution on the wave run-up in deep-water conditions. The results suggest that extreme run-up events in deep water may occur as a result of the disintegration of incident wave groups into envelope solitons.},

   abstract = {This article describes a one-dimensional numerical model of a shallow-water flume with an in-built piston paddle moving boundary wavemaker. The model is based on a set of enhanced Boussinesq equations and the nonlinear shallow water equations. Wave breaking is described approximately, by locally switching to the nonlinear shallow water equations when a critical wave steepness is reached. The moving shoreline is calculated as part of the solution. The piston paddle wavemaker operates on a movable grid, which is Lagrangian on the paddle face and Eulerian away from the paddle. The governing equations are, however, evolved on a fixed mapped grid, and the newly calculated solution is transformed back onto the moving grid via a domain mapping technique. Validation test results are compared against analytical solutions, confirming correct discretisation of the governing equations, wave generation via the numerical paddle, and movement of the wet/dry front. Simulations are presented that reproduce laboratory experiments of wave runup on a plane beach and wave overtopping of a laboratory seawall, involving solitary waves and compact wave groups. In practice, the numerical model is suitable for simulating the propagation of weakly dispersive waves and can additionally model any associated inundation, overtopping or inland flooding within the same simulation.},

   abstract = {The motion of a collection of vertical strings subject to horizontal linear vibrations in the plane can be described by a system of first order nonlinear conservations laws. This system - that we call the Chaplygin-Born-Infeld (CBI) system - is related to Magnetohydrodynamics and more specifically to its shallow water version. Then, each vibrating string can be interpreted as a magnetic line. The CBI system is also related to the Born-Infeld theory for the electromagnetic field, a nonlinear correction to the classical Maxwell’s equations. Due to the linearity of vibrations, there is a priori no mechanism to prevent the strings to cross each other, at least for sufficiently large initial impulse. These crossings generate concentration singularities in the CBI system. A numerical scheme is introduced to maintain order preserving strings beyond singularities. This order preserving scheme is shown to be convergent to a distinguished limit, which can be interpreted, through maximal monotone operator theory, as a vanishing viscosity limit of the CBI system. Finally, models of pressureless gas with sticky particles are revisited and a new formulation is provided.},

For the former, it suffices that the Hamiltonian be bounded from below (or above), and then the soliton realizing its minimum (or maximum) is Lyapunov stable. The extremum is approached via the radiation of small-amplitude waves, a process absent in systems with finitely many degrees of freedom. The framework of the nonlinear Schrödinger equation and the three-wave system is used to show how the boundedness of the Hamiltonian - and hence the stability of the soliton minimizing it - can be proved rigorously using the integral estimate method based on the Sobolev embedding theorems. Wave systems with the Hamiltonians unbounded from below must evolve to a collapse, which can be considered as the fall of a particle in an unbounded potential. The radiation of small-amplitude waves promotes collapse in this case.},

The explicit solutions are compared to numerical approximations previously given in Ali and Kalisch (2013), and to numerical approximations of solutions of the full Euler equations in the same situation Teles da Silva and Peregrine (1988). These comparisons show that the long-wave model yields a fairly accurate approximation of the surface profile as given by the Euler equations up to moderate waveheights. The fluid pressure and the flow underneath the surface are also investigated, and it is found that the long-wave model admits critical layer recirculating flow and non-monotone pressure profiles similar to the flow features of the solutions of the full Euler equations.},

   abstract = {We consider the high-order nonlinear Schrödinger equation derived earlier by Sedletsky Ukr. J. Phys. 48(1), 82 (2003) for the first-harmonic envelope of slowly modulated gravity waves on the surface of finite-depth irrotational, inviscid, and incompressible fluid with flat bottom. This equation takes into account the third-order dispersion and cubic nonlinear dispersive terms. We rewrite this equation in dimensionless form featuring only one dimensionless parameter. We show that one-soliton solutions of the classical nonlinear Schrödinger equation are transformed into quasi-soliton solutions with slowly varying amplitude when the high-order terms are taken into consideration. These quasi-soliton solutions represent the secondary modulations of gravity waves.},

Two model problems are considered: i) the propagation of a "trial" soliton through a one-component "cold" soliton gas consisting of randomly distributed solitons of approximately the same amplitude; and ii) the collision of two cold soliton gases of different amplitudes (the soliton gas shock tube problem) leading to the formation of an expanding incoherent dispersive shock wave. In both cases excellent agreement is observed between the analytical predictions of the soliton gas kinetics and the direct numerical simulations. Our results confirm the relevance of the kinetic equation for solitons as a quantitatively accurate model for macroscopic non-equilibrium dynamics of incoherent soliton ensembles.},

The present article should be considered as a review of some existing models and modelling approaches even if new results are presented as well. Namely, we derive the deep water analogue of the celebrated SERRE-GREEN-NAGHDI equations which have become the standard model in shallow water environments. The relation to existing models is discussed. Moreover, the multi-symplectic structure of these equations is reported as well. The results of this work can be used to develop various types of robust structure-preserving variational integrators in deep water. The methodology of constructing approximate models presented in this study can be naturally extrapolated to other physical flow regimes as well.},

Systems with bounded solutions are shown to possess bounded numerical solutions. A simple system representing cellular convection is solved numerically. All of the solutions are found to be unstable, and almost all of them are nonperiodic. The feasibility of very-long-range weather prediction is examined in the light of these results.},

These expressions also give correspondingly exact forms for asymptotic cases that have been previously studied with some approximations. Earlier approximate results are partly confirmed and partly improved by these more general expressions. The physical status of various expressions and approximations is reconsidered and specified more clearly, including an analysis of what reasonably can be attained in lasers or masers. A general analytical proof is given of the fact that, for a larger detuning of the laser cavity from resonance, a higher value of the laser excitation is required to destabilize the steady-state solution (the second threshold). We also present results for the minimum value of the second threshold at fixed detuning as a function of the other parameters of the system and for the dependence of the ratio of the second threshold to the first threshold as a function of detuning. Minima of the second threshold and of the threshold ratio occur only if the population relaxation rate is equal to zero. The minima of the threshold ratio are shown to be bounded from above as well as from below (as functions of the relaxation rates, so long as the second threshold exists). The upper bound on the minima ratio is equal to 17. The variation of the second threshold in the semi-infinite parameter space of the decay rates is shown at various detunings in plots with a finite domain by normalizing the material relaxation rates to the cavity decay rate.},

On one hand, our model is based on very basic conservation principles. On the other hand, the turbulent nature of the flow is also taken into account through the energy dissipation mechanism. Moreover, the mixing with the pure water along with sediments entrainment and deposition processes are considered, which makes the problem dynamically interesting. One of the main advantages of our model is that it requires the specification of only two modeling parameters - the rate of turbulent dissipation and the rate of the pure water entrainment. Consequently, the resulting model turns out to be very simple and self-consistent. This model is validated against several experimental data and several special classes of solutions (such as travelling, self-similar and steady) are constructed. Unsteady simulations show that some special solutions are realized as asymptotic long time states of dynamic trajectories.},

The experiments were conducted in a channel that had a running length of 13 lock depths, and could be inclined to a maximum angle of 17°. The release of heavy dyed salt solution from a lock with an aspect ratio (height to length) of 0.5, was examined using video images to determine the front velocity, and a particle-tracking technique was used to measure the two-dimensional velocity field in a vertical slice through the centre of the evolving current. The gravity current head velocity increased with time and downstream distance to a maximum at approximately 10 lock depths from the front of the lock. Flow visualization and the velocity measurements have shown that during the acceleration phase the head was being fed by a following current that increased its buoyancy as it propagated downstream. A modified version of the theory of P. Beghin, E. J. Hopfinger and R. E. Britter (J. Fluid Mech. vol. 107, 1981, p. 407) in which the measured increase in buoyancy was used, instead of the original assumption of constant buoyancy, gave results that agreed closely with the experimental velocity versus time histories.},

In this paper, the authors solve the one and two-dimensional time-dependent coupled sine-Gordon equations using RBFs collocation and RBF-QR methods and show how one can overcome the ill-conditioning of coefficient matrix for the small shape parameters using RBF-QR method. The main aim of the current paper is to show that the meshless techniques based on the collocation methods are also suitable for solving the system of coupled nonlinear equations especially sine-Gordon equation. Several test problems are employed and results of numerical experiments are presented and also are compared with analytical solutions.

   abstract = {The applications of hydrodynamics to naval architecture and marine engineering expanded dramatically in the 1960s and 1970s. This classic textbook, originally published in 1977, filled the need for a single volume on the applications of hydrodynamics to marine problems. The book is solidly based on fundamentals, but it also guides the student to an understanding of engineering applications through its consideration of realistic configurations. The book takes a balanced approach between theory and empirics, providing the necessary theoretical background for an intelligent evaluation and application of empirical procedures. It also serves as an introduction to more specialized research methods. It unifies the seemingly diverse problems of marine hydrodynamics by examining them not as separate problems but as related applications of the general field of hydrodynamics. The book evolved from a first-year graduate course in MIT's Department of Ocean Engineering. A knowledge of advanced calculus is assumed. Students will find a previous introductory course in fluid dynamics helpful, but the book presents the necessary fundamentals in a self-contained manner.},

The BEM mesh on the free surface is generated through a combination of the structured and unstructured meshes. Through some auxiliary functions, the mutual dependence of fluid/structure motions is decoupled, which allows the body acceleration to be obtained without the knowledge of the pressure distribution. The solitary wave is used as the case study for the transient wave. It is obtained by the third order theory and the fully nonlinear theory. The accuracy of the present numerical model is verified through the steady propagation of a solitary wave and comparison with the published results for solitary wave interaction with a vertical wall. Simulations are then made to study solitary wave interaction with a truncated cylinder. Numerical results are provided for motions, forces and run-ups on the cylinder and comparison between results for the fixed cylinder and the freely floating cylinder is also made.},

Attention is focused on an effective calculation of the hydrodynamic force associated with the temporal derivative of the velocity potential in the Bernoulli pressure equation. Unlike other existing methods, the acceleration field can be computed simultaneously with the velocity field, which contributes greatly to a reduction in the computation time. Computations are performed for a wall-sided model and a flared model, and numerical results of the waves at upwave and downwave positions and the body motions (sway, heave and roll) are compared with corresponding experiments. The overall agreement is very good, confirming the validity of the present method. The parametric oscillation in roll, observed for the flared model, is also discussed.},

In this MEL formulation a standard Laplace formulation is used to handle arbitrary body shapes using unstructured - possibly hybrid - meshes consisting of high-order curvilinear iso-parametric quadrilateral/triangular elements to represent the body surfaces and for the evolving free surface. Importantly, our numerical analysis highlights that a single top layer of quadrilaterals elements resolves temporal instabilities in the numerical MEL scheme that are known to be associated with mesh topology containing asymmetric element orderings. The 'surface variable only' free surface formulation based on introducing a particle-following (Lagrangian) reference frame contains quartic nonlinear terms that require proper treatment by numerical discretisation due to the possibility of strong aliasing effects. We demonstrate how to stabilise this nonlinear MEL scheme using an efficient combination of (i) global L2 projection without quadrature errors, (ii) mild nonlinear spectral filtering and (iii) re-meshing techniques. Numerical experiments revisiting known benchmarks are presented, and highlights that modelling using a high-order spectral element method provides excellent accuracy in prediction of nonlinear and dispersive wave propagation, and of nonlinear wave-induced loads on fixed submerged and surface-piercing bodies.},

An understanding of the hydrodynamic interactions in such arrays is essential for determining optimum layouts of WECs, as well as calculating the area of ocean that the farms will require. It is equally important to consider the potential impact of wave farms on the local and distal wave climates and coastal processes; a poor understanding of the resulting environmental impact may hamper progress, as it would make planning consents more difficult to obtain. It is therefore clear that an understanding the interactions between WECs within a farm is vital for the continued development of the wave energy industry.},

Similar pumping behaviours are reported. Surface envelopes of the free surface are shown and outline two different dynamics: U-tube oscillator and wave/resonance pumping. The latter is particularly interesting, since, from an oscillatory motion, a unidirectional flow with small to moderate oscillations is generated. A linear theory is developed to evaluate pseudo-analytically the resonance frequencies of the pump using eigenfunction expansions, and a simplified model is proposed to understand the main pumping mechanism in this type of pump. It is found that the Stokes mass transport is driving the pump. The conversion of energy from paddle oscillation to mean flow is evaluated. Efficiency up to 22 % is reported.},

   abstract = {Excessive levels of moisture in buildings lead to building pathologies. To highlight the risk of occurrence of each type of pathology, numerous durability indexes and associated models were defined in the literature. These models are based on the knowledge of the relative humidity, the moisture content and/or the temperature level. In the case of hygroscopic building materials, the hygrothermal fields are evaluated by solving heat, air and moisture transfer equations. In this work, we aim to analyze two mould prediction indexes and models frequently used in the building physics field (Mould index M and VTT model, TOW and Sedlbauer’s isopleths). The results are first discussed regarding the anisotropy of transport properties and the hysteresis of the sorption isotherms and then compared to recent laboratory results obtained on wooden materials found in the literature. The observed difference between simulation and experimental data allows highlighting the necessity of either upgrading of the mould growth models or developing new accurate experiments.},

   abstract = {The asymptotic derivation of a new family of one-dimensional, weakly nonlinear and weakly dispersive equations that model the flow of an ideal fluid in an elastic vessel is presented. Dissipative effects due to the viscous nature of the fluid are also taken into account. The new models validate by asymptotic reasoning other non-dispersive systems of equations that are commonly used, and improve other nonlinear and dispersive mathematical models derived to describe the blood flow in elastic vessels. The new systems are studied analytically in terms of their basic characteristic properties such as the linear dispersion characteristics, symmetries, conservation laws and solitary waves. Unidirectional model equations are also derived and analysed in the case of vessels of constant radius. The capacity of the models to be used in practical problems is being demonstrated by employing a particular system with favourable properties to study the blood flow in a large artery. Two different cases are considered: A vessel with constant radius and a tapered vessel. Significant changes in the flow can be observed in the case of the tapered vessel.},

This does not, of course, preclude the possibility that the effect may be appreciable in certain regions, and Longuet-Higgins (3), for example, has shown this to be the case near the crests for waves on the point of breaking. They also add, which is probably rather more pertinent, that difficulties arise when a solid boundary pierces the surface, since an additional boundary condition is required at the intersection, but give no indication as to what the boundary condition should be.},

The algorithm complexity is $O(N\log N)$ , $N$ being the number of Fourier modes. This feature allows the arbitrary precision computation of waves in arbitrary depth, i.e. it works efficiently for Stokes, cnoidal and solitary waves, even for quite large steepnesses, up to approximately 99 % of the maximum steepness for all wavelengths. In particular, the possibility to compute very long (cnoidal) waves accurately is a feature not shared by other algorithms and asymptotic expansions. The method is based on conformal mapping, the Babenko equation rewritten in a suitable way, the pseudo-spectral method and Petviashvili iterations. The efficiency of the algorithm is illustrated via some relevant numerical examples. The code is open source, so interested readers can easily check the claims, use and modify the algorithm.},

The first part is the more descriptive, and geological of the two. It deals with the concept of water resources, which then leads us on to other links in the cycle: rainfall, infiltration, evaporation. runoff, and surface water resources. The second part is necessary in order to quantify ground water resources. It points the way to other applications, such as solutions to civil engineering problems including drainage and compaction; and transport problems in porous media, including aquifer pollution by miscible fluids, multiphase flow of immiscible fluids, and heat transfer in porous media, i.e., geothermal problems. However, the qualitative and the quantitative aspects are not treated separately but combined and blended together, just as geology and hydrology are woven together in hydrogeology.},

By applying operator splitting to a complicated model one can often split it into simpler problems that can be analyzed separately. In this book one studies operator splitting for a family of nonlinear evolution equations, including hyperbolic conservation laws and degenerate convection-diffusion equations. Common for these equations is the prevalence of rough, or non-smooth, solutions, e.g., shocks.},

The general mathematical formulation for this problem is presented in the framework of a hierarchy of mathematical models. Namely, in this first part we formulate the problem at every hierarchical level. The special attention is payed to fully nonlinear and weakly dispersive models since they are most likely to be used in practice. For this model we have to consider separately the inner (under the body) and outer domains. Various approached to the gluing of solutions at the boundary is discussed as well. We propose several strategies which ensure the global conservation or continuity of some important physical quantities.},

   abstract = {Classical fluid mechanics is a branch of continuum mechanics; that is, it proceeds on the assumption that a fluid is practically continuous and homogeneous in structure. The fundamental property which distinguishes a fluid from other continuous media is that it cannot be in equilibrium in a state of stress such that the mutual action between two adjacent parts is oblique to the common surface. Though this property is the basis of hydrostatics and hydrodynamics, it is by itself insufficient for the description of fluid motion. In order to characterize the physical behavior of a fluid the property must be extended, given suitable analytical form, and introduced into the equations of motion of a general continuous medium, this leading ultimately to a system of differential equations which are to be satisfied by the, velocity, density, pressure, etc. of an arbitrary fluid motion. In this article we shall consider these differential equations, their derivation from fundamental axioms, and the various forms which they take when more or less special assumptions concerning the fluid or the fluid motion are made.},

   abstract = {Numerical solutions for two‐dimensional or axisymmetric viscous fluid flow problems are usually based on the stream function/vorticity formulation. Frequently, however, the pressure distribution is of prime interest. Difficulties have been reported in the literature with the use of obvious pressure marching schemes. Consequently, several investigators have preferred to use an iterative method which involves solving a Poisson equation with Neumann boundary conditions. In this paper, the fundamental cause of failure of the marching schemes is investigated. The authors introduce the concept of compatible pressure and vorticity schemes and show that lack of compatibility has been the principal reason for the poor results obtained using marching schemes. Compatible pressure marching methods are developed and shown to give good results. Comparisons are made between the Poisson equation method and the compatible marching method. To make the comparisons meaningful, special test cases with analytical solutions have been used.},

   abstract = {This paper proposes the use of a Spectral method to simulate diffusive moisture transfer through porous materials as a reduced-order model (ROM). The Spectral approach is an a priori method assuming a separated representation of the solution. The method is compared with both classical Euler implicit and Crank-Nicolson schemes, considered as large original models. Their performance - in terms of accuracy, complexity reduction and CPU time reduction - is discussed for linear and nonlinear cases of moisture diffusive transfer through single and multilayered one-dimensional domains, considering highly moisture-dependent properties. Results show that the Spectral ROM approach enables to simulate accurately the field of interest. Furthermore, numerical gains become particularly interesting for nonlinear cases since the proposed method can drastically reduce the computer run time, by a factor of 100, when compared to the traditional Crank-Nicolson scheme for one-dimensional applications.},

The solution has been obtained by solving an enlarged system that includes an additional equation for the bottom geometry and then using the principles of conservation of mass and momentum across the step. The resulting solution is unique and satisfies the principle of dissipation of energy across the shock wave. We provide examples of possible wave patterns. Numerical solution of a first-order dissipative scheme as well as an implementation of our Riemann solver in the second-order upwind method are compared with the proposed exact Riemann problem solution.

   abstract = {The similarity solution to the Riemann problem of the one dimensional shallow water equations (SWE) with a bottom step discontinuity is presented. The step is placed at the same location where the flow variables are initially discontinuous. While the solutions found are still a superposition of travelling waves belonging to the two well-known families of the shallow water system, namely hydraulic jumps and rarefactions, the appearance of a standing discontinuity at the step position produces a very interesting solution pattern. This is mainly due to the asymmetry introduced by the step. The adopted solution procedure combines the basic theory of hyperbolic systems of conservation laws together with a sound interpretation of the physical concepts embedded in the shallow water system. This finally leads to a set of algebraic equations that must be iteratively solved. The ideas contained in this paper may be of valuable help to the understanding of the behaviour of the SWE with source terms, that constitute the core of many mathematical models for free surface flow simulation.},

We show that the proposed framework allows the control of the coupling conditions and we propose an approximate Riemann solver based on a relaxation approach preserving equilibrium solutions of the coupled problem. Numerical experiments in constrained optimization problems are then presented to assess the performances of the present method.},

Two different plastics are tested, with different densities and mechanical properties, and three different configurations are tested. The configurations include freely floating plates, loosely moored plates (to restrict drift), and plates with edge barriers (to restrict waves overwashing the plates). The wave fields reflected and transmitted by plates without barriers are shown to become irregular, as the incident waves become steeper, particularly for the denser plastic and the moored plate. Further, the proportion of energy transmitted by the plates without barriers is shown to decrease as the incident wave becomes steeper, and this is related to wave energy dissipation.},

This technique is based on local variations in amplitude and phase of the measured wave and uses wavelet analysis. Second, the method is applied to perform a parametric study to compare the reflection and transmission characteristics of flexible and rigid breakwaters. Results are discussed for different depths of submergence of the models, different internal pressures in the case of the flexible breakwater, and a wide range of wave steepnesses. The results show that, in general, the rigid model has a higher reflection coefficient than the flexible model. On the other hand, the flexible model has a much higher energy-loss coefficient. Optimal breakwater widths for reflection, transmission, and energy-loss coefficients for waves with different wavelengths are also presented.},

We present selected numerical examples which demonstrate the excellent accuracy, conservation and convergence characteristics of AVIs. In these tests, AVIs are found to result in substantial speed‐ups, at equal accuracy, relative to explicit Newmark. A mathematical proof of convergence of the AVIs is also presented in this paper. Finally, we develop the subject of horizontal variations and configurational forces in discrete dynamics. This theory leads to exact path‐independent characterizations of the configurational forces acting on discrete systems. Notable examples are the configurational forces acting on material nodes in a finite element discretisation; and the J‐integral at the tip of a crack in a finite element mesh.},

   abstract = {The reliability of a model is its accuracy in predicting the physical phenomena using the known input parameters. It also depends on the model's ability to estimate relevant parameters using observations of the physical phenomena. In this paper, the reliability of the VTT model is investigated under these two criteria for various given temperature and relative humidity constant in time. First of all, experiments are conducted on bamboo fiberboard. Using these data, five parameters of the VTT model, defining the mold vulnerability class of a material, are identified. The results highlight that the determined parameters are not within the range of the classes defined in the VTT model. In addition, the quality of the parameter estimation is not satisfactory. Then the sensitivity of the numerical results of the VTT model is analyzed by varying an input parameter. These investigations show that the VTT mathematical formulation of the physical model of mold growth is not reliable. An improved model is proposed with a new mathematical formulation. It is inspired by the logistic equation whose parameters are estimated using the experimental data obtained. The parameter estimation is very satisfactory. In the last parts of the paper, the numerical predictions of the improved model are compared to experimental data from the literature to prove its reliability.},

   abstract = {The seventh edition of this classic text has retained the features that make it popular, while updating its treatment and inclusion of Computer Algebra Systems and Programming Languages. Interesting and timely applications motivate and enhance readers' understanding of methods and analysis of results. This text incorporates a balance of theory with techniques and applications, including optional theory-based sections in each chapter. The exercise sets include additional challenging problems and projects which show practical applications of the material. Also, sections which discuss the use of computer algebra systems such as Maple®,Mathematica®, and MATLAB®, facilitate the integration of technology in the course. Furthermore, the text incorporates programming material in both FORTRAN and C. The breadth of topics, such as partial differential equations, systems of nonlinear equations, and matrix algebra, provide comprehensive and flexible coverage of all aspects of numerical analysis.},

   abstract = {Progress in mathematical modeling of complex industrial and environmental systems has enabled numerical simulations of most physical phenomena. In addition, recent advances in thermal instrumentation and heat transfer modeling have improved experimental procedures and indirect measurements for heat transfer research of both natural phenomena and manmade applications. These new resources and methods help theoretical, computational, and experimental researchers synergistically interact to better understand the physical phenomena being studied. This book explores how inverse analysis can be used to increase understanding of interactions between technological systems and nature, by bridging the gap between data derived from measurements and information from theoretical predictions.},

Besides the power and ingenuity of their methods and the depth and beauty of their results, their importance is fast growing in Analysis as well as in theoretical and applied Proba­ bility. These additions increased the book to an unwieldy size and it had to be split into two volumes. About half of the first volume is devoted to an elementary introduc­ tion, then to mathematical foundations and basic probability concepts and tools. The second half is devoted to a detailed study of Independ­ ence which played and continues to playa central role both by itself and as a catalyst. The main additions consist of a section on convergence of probabilities on metric spaces and a chapter whose first section on domains of attrac­ tion completes the study of the Central limit problem, while the second one is devoted to random walks. About a third of the second volume is devoted to conditioning and properties of sequences of various types of dependence. The other two thirds are devoted to random functions; the last Part on Elements of random analysis is more sophisticated. The main addition consists of a chapter on Brownian motion and limit distributions.},

This effort led to an innovative, in many aspects, way of presenting BEM, including the derivation of fundamental solutions, the integral representation of the solutions and the boundary integral equations for various governing differential equations in a simple way minimizing a recourse to mathematics with which the student is not familiar. The indicial and tensorial notations, though they facilitate the author's work and allow to borrow ready to use expressions from the literature, have been avoided in the present book. Nevertheless, all the necessary preliminary mathematical concepts have been included in order to make the book complete and self-sufficient.},

Different from the Finite Element and the Finite Difference methods, the discretization and approximation of the collocation method is based on a set of unstructured points in space. This “meshless” feature is attractive because it eliminates the bookkeeping requirements of the “element” based methods. This text discusses several types of collocation methods including the radial basis function method, the Trefftz method, and the coupled collocation and finite element method. Governing equations investigated include Laplace, Poisson, Helmholtz and biharmonic equations. Regular boundary value problems, boundary value problems with singularity, and Eigenvalue problems are also examined. Rigorous mathematical proofs are contained in these chapters, and many numerical experiments are also provided to support the algorithms and to verify the theory. A tutorial on the applications of these methods is also provided.},

This feature not only reduces the number of algebraic equations to be solved, but, in two and three space dimensions, it also eliminates the problems of mesh generation. Both of these factors contribute to reducing the computational cost. A potential method is described which provides numerical solutions of the transient diffusion equation for two-dimensional problems. The solutions are generally as accurate as conventional techniques whilst retaining the advantage of a reduction in dimensionality throughout the time domain. The numerical study, however, also indicates that the method may have limitations, particularly when there are discontinuities at the boundaries.},

   abstract = {An accessible introduction to the finite element method for solving numeric problems, this volume offers the keys to an important technique in computational mathematics. Suitable for advanced undergraduate and graduate courses, it outlines clear connections with applications and considers numerous examples from a variety of science- and engineering-related specialties.This text encompasses all varieties of the basic linear partial differential equations, including elliptic, parabolic and hyperbolic problems, as well as stationary and time-dependent problems. Additional topics include finite element methods for integral equations, an introduction to nonlinear problems, and considerations of unique developments of finite element techniques related to parabolic problems, including methods for automatic time step control. The relevant mathematics are expressed in non-technical terms whenever possible, in the interests of keeping the treatment accessible to a majority of students.},

Cheung, The Finite Element Method in Structural and Continuum Mechanics, McGraw-Hill, London), over two hundred monographs and conference proceedings have been published on the subject. For the benefit of the readers of this journal, all of the English books and some of the foreign books that the author is aware of are listed herein. Also included is a list of the conference proceedings devoted solely to finite elements. The references are divided into the following eleven categories: fundamentals; mathematical foundations; structural and solid mechanics applications; fluid mechanics applications; other applied science and engineering applications; computer implementation and software systems, computational and modeling aspects; special topics; boundary element methods; bibliographies; and proceedings of symposia and conferences on finite element technology. The references in each of the first ten sections are arranged alphabetically, and in the last section they are arranged in chronological order.},

Using computer-generated data, we investigate a number of different models, including both monic and non-monic polynomials. Our data support conjectures made by Odlyzko and Poonen and by Konyagin, and we formulate a universality heuristic and new conjectures that connect their work with Hilbert’s Irreducibility Theorem and work of van der Waerden. The data indicate that the probability that a random polynomial is reducible divided by the probability that there is a linear factor appears to approach a constant and, in the large-degree limit, this constant appears to approach 1. In cases where the model makes it impossible for the random polynomial to have a linear factor, the probability of reducibility appears to be close to the probability of having a nonlinear, low-degree factor. We also study characteristic polynomials of random matrices with + 1 and − 1 entries.},

Strong interactions occur when the wave phase speeds are nearly equal although the waves belong to different modes. This case is described by a pair of coupled Korteweg‐de Vries equations, for which some preliminary numerical results are presented.},

Basic bifurcations are studied together with bifurcations in the presence of symmetries. Special attention is given to examples with reversible vector fields, including the physical example given by the water waves. In this second edition, many problems with detailed solutions are added at the end of the first part (some systems being in infinite dimensions). The second part deals with the Couette-Taylor hydrodynamical stability problem, between concentric rotating cylinders. The spatial structure of various steady or unsteady solutions results directly from the analysis of the reduced system on a center manifold. In this part we also study bifurcations (simple here) from group orbits of solutions in an elementary way (avoiding heavy algebra). The third part analyzes bifurcations from time periodic solutions of autonomous vector fields. A normal form theory is developed, covering all cases, and emphasizing a partial Floquet reduction theory, which is applicable in infinite dimensions. Studies of period doubling as well as Arnold's resonance tongues are included in this part.},

Applications are reviewed to systems arising from a variety of disciplines. With the aid of numerical methods, three examples are presented in detail, one of which is infinite dimensional.},

Exact theory for such waves has been developed and applied to single equations of Korteweg-de Vries type, Schrödinger-type and regularized long-wave-type for example. Much less common has been the analysis of solitary-wave solutions for systems of equations. The present paper is concerned with solitary travelling-wave solutions to systems of equations arising in fluid mechanics and other areas of science and engineering. The aim is to show that appropriate modification of the methods coming to the fore for single equations may be effectively applied to systems as well. This contention is demonstrated explicitly for the Gear- Grimshaw system modeling the interaction of internal waves and for the Boussinesq systems that arise in describing the two-way propagation of long-crested surface water waves.},

   abstract = {The use of thermal insulation in roofing systems has been progressively increased in the last few years especially in emerging market countries to reduce energy consumption due to the more frequent use of air conditioners. However, moisture can meaningfully affect the performance of the roof and cause deterioration of the insulation as well as increasing the risk of mold growth. Therefore, for the prediction of performance and risks in roofing systems, a fully combined heat and mass transport model through roofing systems used in hot and humid climates is needed as it is barely explored in the literature. In this way, a mathematical model considering the combined two-dimensional heat, air and moisture transport through unsaturated roofing systems is presented in this paper. In the porous domain, the differential governing equations are based on driving potentials of temperature, moist air pressure and water vapor pressure gradients, while, in the air domain, a lumped approach is considered for modeling the heat and mass transfer through the cavity between the roof sheet and insulation. Results are presented in terms of heat flux and temperature and moisture content distributions profiles within the porous roofing structure, indicating the impact of moisture adsorption and desorption on the roofing hygrothermal performance due to additional transport mechanisms. The paper shows the importance of using a more complete mathematical model - even when conductive latent loads are negligible due to an impermeable reflective insulation - since the mass transport and phase change mechanisms modify the temperature distribution, which cannot be observed by purely conductive heat transfer models presently used in most building energy simulation tools. The roofing short and long-wave radiation heat transfer processes, including the multi-reflective effect of aluminum foil in the air cavity, are also presented and discussed.},

   abstract = {This work presents an efficient numerical method based on spectral expansions for simulation of heat and moisture diffusive transfers through multilayered porous materials. Traditionally, by using the finite‐difference approach, the problem is discretized in time and space domains (method of lines) to obtain a large system of coupled ordinary differential equations (ODEs), which is computationally expensive. To avoid such a cost, this paper proposes a reduced‐order method that is faster and accurate, using a much smaller system of ODEs. To demonstrate the benefits of this approach, three case studies are presented. The first one considers nonlinear heat and moisture transfer through one material layer. The second case, ie, highly nonlinear, imposes a high moisture content gradient, simulating a rain‐like condition, over a two‐layered domain, whereas the last one compares the numerical prediction against experimental data for validation purposes. Results show how the nonlinearities and the interface between materials are easily and naturally treated with the spectral reduced‐order method. Concerning the reliability part, predictions show a good agreement with experimental results, which confirm robustness, calculation efficiency, and high accuracy of the proposed approach for predicting the coupled heat and moisture transfer through porous materials.},

Experimental intermediate scanning curves of hemp concrete are measured and used to compare two hysteresis models, Huang’s model and Carmeliet’s model. An original method is achieved to fit the numerical results on the experimental ones leading to the identification of the main desorption curve. The most relevant model, Huang’s model, is implemented in a heat and moisture transfer model based on Künzel formalism. The transient hydric response of hemp concrete submitted to cyclic hydric loadings is investigated and compared to experimental results issued from the literature. These investigations show the relevance to consider the hysteresis phenomenon into the model. Then, the influence of initial conditions is discussed. The results point out that transient response of hemp concrete strongly depends on the initial hydric state (initial moisture content as well as initial relative humidity).},

A moving mesh strategy based on the so-called moving mesh PDE is used to adaptively move the mesh to improve computational accuracy and efficiency. The RLW equation represents a class of partial differential equations containing spatial-time mixed derivatives. For the numerical solution of those equations, a C0 finite element method cannot apply directly on a moving mesh since the mixed derivatives of the finite element approximation may not be defined. To avoid this difficulty, a new variable is introduced and the RLW equation is rewritten into a system of two coupled equations. The system is then discretized using linear finite elements in space and the fifth-order Radau IIA scheme in time. A range of numerical examples in one and two dimensions, including the RLW equation with one or two solitary waves and special initial conditions that lead to the undular bore and solitary train solutions, are presented. Numerical results demonstrate that the method has a second order convergence and is able to move and adapt the mesh to the evolving features in the solution.},

The study comprises a series of highly resolved direct numerical simulations for a range of slope angles between $5^\{\circ \}$ and $20^\{\circ \}$ . The simulations were fixed at Reynolds number $Re=5000$ for all slopes considered. The temporal evolution of the front is compared to available experimental data. One of the interesting aspects of this study is the detection of a converging flow towards the centre of the gravity current. This converging flow is a result of the finite volume of the release coupled with the presence of a sloping boundary, which results in a second acceleration phase in the front velocity of the current. The details of the dynamics of this second acceleration and the redistribution of material in the current leading to its development will be discussed. These finite-release currents are invariably dominated by the head where most of the mixing and ambient entrainment occurs. We propose a simple method for defining the head of the current from which we extract various properties including the front Froude number and entrainment coefficient. The Froude number is seen to increase with steeper slopes, whereas the entrainment coefficient is observed to be weakly dependent on the bottom slope.},

Fluid Dyn. , vol. 28, 2014, pp. 521-529) which demonstrated that gravity currents initiating from non-axisymmetric cross-sectional geometries do not become axisymmetric, nor do they retain their initial shape during the slumping and inertial phases of spreading, we show that such non-axisymmetric currents eventually reach a self-similar regime during which (i) the local front propagation scales as $t^\{1/2\}$ as in circular releases and (ii) the non-axisymmetric front has a self-similar shape that primarily depends on the aspect ratio of the initial release. Complementary experiments of non-Boussinesq currents and top-spreading currents suggest that this self-similar dynamics is independent of the density ratio, vertical aspect ratio, wall friction and Reynolds number $\mathit\{Re\}$ , provided the last is large, i.e. $\mathit\{Re\}\geqslant O(10^\{4\})$ . The local instantaneous front Froude number obtained from the fully resolved simulations is compared to existing models of Froude functions. The recently reported extended box model is capable of capturing the dynamics of such non-axisymmetric flows. Here we use the extended box model to propose a relation for the self-similar horizontal aspect ratio $\{\it\chi\}_\{\infty \}$ of the propagating front as a function of the initial horizontal aspect ratio $\{\it\chi\}_\{0\}$ , namely $\{\it\chi\}_\{\infty \}=1+(\ln \{\it\chi\}_\{0\})/3$ . The experimental and numerical results are in good agreement with the proposed relation.},

The discretization of the equations in conservation form implies the modification of the time derivative of the conserved variable, in the form of a mass/inertia matrix, and extra terms in the flux functions. The effect of this matrix is to slow down wave propagation in the presence of significant bottom slopes. The proposed model is first derived in conservation form using mass and momentum balance principles. Its finite volume implementation is then presented. The additional terms to the shallow water equations can be discretized very easily via a simple time-stepping procedure. Two application examples are presented. These examples seem to indicate that the proposed model does not exhibit strong differences with the classical hydrostatic shallow water model under steady-state conditions, but that its behavior is significantly different when transients are involved.},

   abstract = {This work presents an alternative view on the numerical simulation of diffusion processes applied to the heat and moisture transfer through porous building materials. Traditionally, by using the finite-difference approach, the discretization follows the Method Of Lines (MOL), when the problem is first discretized in space to obtain a large system of coupled Ordinary Differential Equations (ODEs). Thus, this paper proposes to change this viewpoint. First, we discretize in time to obtain a small system of coupled ODEs, which means instead of having a Cauchy (Initial Value) Problem (IVP), we have a Boundary Value Problem (BVP). Fortunately, BVPs can be solved efficiently today using adaptive collocation methods of high order. To demonstrate the benefits of this new approach, three case studies are presented, in which one of them is compared with experimental data. The first one considers nonlinear heat and moisture transfer through one material layer while the second one considers two material layers. Results show how the nonlinearities and the interface between materials are easily treated, by reasonably using a fourth-order adaptive method. Finally, the last case study compares numerical results with experimental measurements, showing a good agreement.},

Nevertheless, building insulation can generate high expenditures so that the selection of an optimum insulation thickness requires a detailed energy simulation as well as an economic analysis. In this way, the present study proposes an innovative non-uniform adaptive method to determine the optimal insulation thickness of external walls. First, the method is compared with a reference solution to properly understand the features of the method, which can provide high accuracy with less spatial nodes. Then, the adaptive method is used to simulate the transient heat conduction through the building envelope of buildings located in Brazil, where there is a large potential of energy reduction. Simulations have been efficiently carried out for different wall and roof configurations, showing that the innovative method efficiently provides a gain of 25% on the computer run-time.},

Moreover, we derive from the first principles a depth-averaged model. Then, we assume that sediments are uniformly distributed along the slope. In this case, they can be entrained into the flow head and a self-sustained regime can be established. One of the main findings of our study is that the avalanche front velocity is not unique due to a hysteresis phenomenon.

   abstract = {This work presents a detailed mathematical model combined with an innovative efficient numerical model to predict heat, air and moisture transfer through porous building materials. The model considers the transient effects of air transport and its impact on the heat and moisture transfer. The achievement of the mathematical model is detailed in the continuity of Luikov’s work. A system composed of two advection-diffusion differential equations plus one exclusively diffusion equation is derived. The main issue to take into account the transient air transfer arises in the very small characteristic time of the transfer, implying very fine discretisation. To circumvent these difficulties, the numerical model is based on the Du Fort-Frankel explicit and unconditionally stable scheme for the exclusively diffusion equation. It is combined with a two-step Runge-Kutta scheme in time with the Scharfetter-Gummel numerical scheme in space for the coupled advection-diffusion equations. At the end, the numerical model enables to relax the stability condition, and, therefore, to save important computational efforts. A validation case is considered to evaluate the efficiency of the model for a nonlinear problem. Results highlight a very accurate solution computed about 16 times faster than standard approaches. After this numerical validation, the reliability of the mathematical model is evaluated by comparing the numerical predictions to experimental observations. The latter is measured within a multi-layered wall submitted to a sudden increase of vapor pressure on the inner side and driven climate boundary conditions on the outer side. A very satisfactory agreement is noted between the numerical predictions and experimental observations indicating an overall good reliability of the proposed model.},

   abstract = {The class B of lacunary polynomials f(x) := -1 + x + x^n + x^\{m_1\} + x^\{m_2\} + ... + x^\{m_s\}, where s >= 0, m_1 - n >= n - 1, m_\{q+1\} - m_\{q\} >= n - 1 for 1 <= q < s, n >= 3 is studied. A polynomial having its coefficients in \{0, 1\} except its constant coefficient equal to -1 is called an almost Newman polynomial. A general theorem of factorization of the almost Newman polynomials of the class B is obtained. Such polynomials possess lenticular roots in the open unit disk off the unit circle in the small angular sector \pi/18 <= arg z <= \pi/18 and their nonreciprocal parts are always irreducible. The existence of lenticuli of roots is a peculiarity of the class B. By comparison with the Odlyzko - Poonen Conjecture and its variant Conjecture, an ``Asymptotic Reducibility Conjecture'' is formulated aiming at establishing the proportion of irreducible polynomials in this class. This proportion is conjectured to be 3/4 and estimated using Monte-Carlo methods. The numerical approximate value ~ 0.756 is obtained. The results extend those on trinomials (Selmer) and quadrinomials (Ljunggren, Mills, Finch and Jones).},

It also presents the results of a study on rising damp based upon a practical year-long test. Measurements were made on rising damp on walls made from different mortars and the observations were compared with theoretical models. It was found that mortar characteristics would significantly affect the height of rising damp. It was also observed that there was a strong correlation between rising damp and the Sharp Front Model, and the rate of absorption of water into the mortar was a key factor in determining the height of the rising damp front. In addition, walls with rising damp treatment are warmer than their control counterparts due to a reduction in surface moisture evaporative cooling.},

Its efficiency is demonstrated by a recent building structure-chuted concrete between fibre board with polystyrol-foam outside insulation-under the boundary conditions of the TRY Essen: hourly values of outdoor climate. As a result of the high built-in moisture, moisture damages (mould growing) in the base level (exterior wall/concrete plate over the basement garage) and inadmissible high heat losses caused by the moisture depending thermal conductivity and the additional enthalpy flows coupled to the moisture movement and phase changing are observed in the first years.},

   abstract = {Until recently, the testing of ODE/DAE software has been limited to simple comparisons and benchmarking. The process of developing software from a mathematically specified method is complex: it entails constructing control structures and objectives, selecting iterative methods and termination criteria, choosing norms and many more decisions. Most software constructors have taken a heuristic approach to these design choices, and as a consequence two different implementations of the same method may show significant differences in performance. Yet it is common to try to deduce from software comparisons that one method is better than another. Such conclusions are not warranted, however, unless the testing is carried out under true ceteris paribus conditions. Moreover, testing is an empirical science and as such requires a formal test protocol; without it conclusions are questionable, invalid or even false.},

   abstract = {The numerical simulation of nonlinear dispersive waves is a central research topic of many investigations in the nonlinear wave community. Simple and robust solvers are needed for numerical studies of water waves as well. The main difficulties arise in the numerical approximation of high order derivatives and in severe stability restrictions on the time step, when explicit schemes are used. In this study we propose new relaxed system formulations which approximate the initial dispersive wave equation. However, the resulting relaxed system involves first order derivatives only and it is written in the form of an evolution problem. Thus, many standard methods can be applied to solve the relaxed problem numerically. In this article we illustrate the application of the new relaxed scheme on the classical Korteweg-de Vries equation as a prototype of stiff dispersive PDEs.},

We consider mesh-moving methods that are based on solving a system of ordinary differential equations for the mesh velocities and show that some of these methods are unstable with respect to an equidistributing mesh when the partial differential system is dissipative. Using linear perturbation techniques, we are able to develop simple criteria for determining the stability of a particular method and show how to construct stable differential systems for the mesh velocities.

We find that some of these iterative adaptive grid generators are preferable to a direct method of integration and interpolation. In contrast with a direct method, appropriate use of these iterative adaptive grid generators produces adaptive grids with a smooth variation of the grid spacing ratio and resolution. All adaptive grid generators are a subclass of a more general iterative map. General features of this iterated map which are related to the function to be resolved are briefly discussed. The results obtained here supplements recent investigations on these adaptive grid generators by the author.},

   abstract = {The background of this paper is the study of transport of pollutants by groundwater flow when released from a repository in a rock salt formation. Flow in regions surrounding such formations may be strongly influenced by variations in salt concentrations, a factor requiring special attention in the development of realistic mathematical models for predicting transport of pollutants. Indispensable for this development are advanced numerical methods. The aim of this paper is to illustrate the application of such a method to a class of non‐linear brine transport problems in one space dimension. Our method is based on the method of lines for solving time‐dependent partial differential equations. The method is of the finite difference type, implicit and thus applicable to wide classes of (one‐space‐dimensional) partial differential equation systems. The main feature of the method, however, is that it can automatically move the spatial grid for evolving time and thus is able to refine the grid in regions with large, special transitions. The grid refinement has provea to be a very valuable facility in the numerical modelling of brine transport problems involving low and high salt concentrations. From the user's point of view an additional advantage of the moving grid method is that it can be implemented in advanced, user‐oriented method‐of‐lines software packages based on implicit stiff ODE solvers. In the brine transport application discussed here we have used the package SPRINT.},

Regarding standing waves, new waveforms and the large effect that small capillarity can have are considered. Faraday waves are discussed principally with regard to viscous effects, hysteresis, and limit cycles; nonlinear waveforms of low mode numbers; contact-line effects and surfactants; breaking and subharmonics; and drop ejection. Pattern formation and chaotic and nonlinear dynamics of Faraday waves are mentioned only briefly. Gravity and gravity-capillary wave generation of parasitic capillaries and dissipation are considered at length. We conclude with our view on the direction of future research in these areas.},

Stable and unstable branches are found to meet, through a saddle-node bifurcation, at a critical speed beyond which no stationary solution exists. For large obstacles, the stable branch is compared with the stationary solutions of the compressible Euler equation without dispersion. Boundary layers are investigated. In this regime, the unstable dynamics are shown to lead to a finite-time dewetting singularity.},

For weakly nonlinear waves, the problem is formulated as a forced fifth-order Korteweg-de Vries (KdV) equation for the free-surface profile. Solutions to the initial value problem for this equation are computed numerically. It is found that there is a wealth of steady and unsteady behaviors, and several regimes are identified by varying the Froude and Bond numbers. This generalizes previous calculations in the absence of surface tension.},

   abstract = {COMCOT is the abbreviation of Cornell Multi-grid Coupled Tsunami model. This tsunami modelling package is developed to study the entire life-span of tsunami, including its generation, propagation, run-up and inundation. The model uses a modified leap-frog finite difference scheme to solve shallow water equations in both Spherical and Cartesian Coordinates. A two-way nested grid algorithm, dynamically coupled up to multiple levels, is implemented in the model to account for the variation of length scales of tsunami during its evolutions in different regions. Multiple tsunami generation mechanisms have also been developed in order to investigate tsunami from a variety of sources. COMCOT has been under development and validation since early 1990’s at Cornell University, USA. Its latest version has been developed by Dr. Xiaoming Wang at the Institute of Geological & Nuclear Science (GNS Science), New Zealand, with his earlier work at Cornell University as well as contributions from other researchers. This document introduces the theoretical background of the numerical model, however, focuses on the parameter configuration, data preparation, input and output of the model and illustrates in detail how to use the package for tsunami simulations.},

   abstract = {This article proposes an efficient explicit numerical model with a relaxed stability condition for the simulation of heat, air, and moisture transfer in porous material. Three innovative approaches are combined to solve the system of two differential advection‐diffusion equations coupled with a purely diffusive equation. First, the DU FORT‐FRANKEL scheme is used to solve the diffusion equation, providing an explicit scheme with an extended stability region. Then, the two advection‐diffusion equations are solved using both the SCHARFETTER‐GUMMEL numerical scheme for the space discretisation and the two‐step RUNGE‐KUTTA method for the time variable. This combination enables to relax the stability condition by one order. The proposed numerical model is evaluated on three case studies. The first one considers quasi‐linear coefficients. The theoretical results of the numerical schemes are confirmed by our computations. Indeed, the stability condition is relaxed by a factor of 40 compared to the standard EULER explicit approach. The second case provides an analytical solution for a weakly nonlinear problem. A very satisfactory accuracy is observed between the reference solution and the one provided by the numerical model. The last case study assumes a more realistic application with nonlinear coefficients and ROBIN‐type boundary conditions. The computational time is reduced 10 times by using the proposed model in comparison with the explicit EULER method.},

   abstract = {Predictions of physical phenomena in buildings are carried out by using physical models formulated as a mathematical problem and solved by means of numerical methods, aiming at evaluating, for instance, the building thermal or hygrothermal performance by calculating distributions and fluxes of heat and moisture transfer. Therefore, the choice of the numerical method is crucial since it is a compromise among (i) the solution accuracy, (ii) the computational cost to obtain the solution and (iii) the complexity of the method implementation. An efficient numerical method enables to compute an accurate solution with a minimum computational run time (CPU). On that account, this article brings an investigation on the performance of three numerical methods. The first one is the standard and widely used finite-difference approach, while the second one is the so-called RC approach, which is a particular method brought to the building physics area by means of an analogy of electric circuits. The third numerical method is the spectral one, which has been recently proposed to solve nonlinear diffusive problems in building physics. The three methods are evaluated in terms of accuracy on the assessment of the dependent variable (temperature or vapor pressure) or of density of fluxes for three different cases: i) heat diffusion through a concrete slab, ii) moisture diffusion through an aerated concrete slab and iii) heat diffusion using measured temperatures as boundary conditions. Results highlight the spectral approach as the most accurate method. The RC based model with a few number of resistances does not provide accurate results for temperature and vapor pressure distributions neither to flux densities nor conduction loads.},

   abstract = {The fidelity of a model relies both on its accuracy to predict the physical phenomena and its capability to estimate unknown parameters using observations. This article focuses on this second aspect by analyzing the reliability of two mathematical models proposed in the literature for the simulation of heat losses through building walls. The first one, named DF, is the classical heat diffusion equation combined with the DuFort–Frankel numerical scheme. The second is the so-called RC lumped approach, based on a simple ordinary differential equation to compute the temperature within the wall. The reliability is evaluated following a two stages method. First, samples of observations are generated using a pseudospectral numerical model for the heat diffusion equation with known input parameters. The results are then modified by adding a noise to simulate experimental measurements. Then, for each sample of observation, the parameter estimation problem is solved using one of the two mathematical models. The reliability is assessed based on the accuracy of the approach to recover the unknown parameter. Three case studies are considered for the estimation of (i) the heat capacity, (ii) the thermal conductivity or (iii) the heat transfer coefficient at the interface between the wall and the ambient air. For all cases, the DF mathematical model has a very satisfactory reliability to estimate the unknown parameters without any bias. However, the RC model lacks of fidelity and reliability. The error on the estimated parameter can reach 40% for the heat capacity, 80% for the thermal conductivity and 450% for the heat transfer coefficient.},

   abstract = {The issue to predict the behavior of building materials during wide horizons of time is still challenging. Experimental set-ups, since they require to perform tests for several years, are costly, never at the full scale and inconvenient. Building Performance Simulation (BPS) programs are designed to perform predictions on computational machines and cut experimental costs significantly. Nonetheless, in the recent review of state–of–the–art, it was indicated that despite the wide range of programs, there are still some drawbacks in terms of the accuracy and the high computational cost. This paper investigates the application of an innovative numerical method, called Super–Time–Stepping (STS) method. It allows performing accurate simulations with time-steps much larger than with standard explicit approaches. These “super” time-steps also enable us to reduce the computational cost. In addition to that, the design of the method allows easier application for models in higher dimensions and with nonlinear parameters. The efficiency of the method is tested on linear and nonlinear academic cases. Further study for the reliability of the model is performed on an experimental case study. The experiment has been carried out on a rammed earth wall during almost 14 months. Obtained data is presented in this article and implemented into proposed model. As a result of the case studies, it is shown that in comparison to the euler explicit method, the STS methods can cut costs by more than five times while maintaining high accuracy and efficiency. A very fine analysis of the physical phenomena is also performed.},

Turbulent stresses are handled by means of the Boussinesq hypothesis, and the eddy viscosity is assumed to vary over the water depth according to different laws. The model is described in detail, and its performances are evaluated both against available analytical solutions and against experimental data of regular waves breaking over a slope. The influence of the vertical structure of turbulence under a breaking wave is analyzed by means of four different vertical profiles of eddy viscosity; the differences in terms of hydrodynamic features are also discussed. Among the four selected profiles, two of them (the uniform one and that with uniform eddy viscosity over the top half of the water column which linearly decreases to zero over the lower half) give better overall performances when compared with experimental data concerning velocity profiles.},

We start the discussion by presenting a particularly simple example of an analogue model, before exploring the rich history and complex tapestry of models discussed in the literature. The last decade in particular has seen a remarkable and sustained development of analogue gravity ideas, leading to some hundreds of published articles, a workshop, two books, and this review article. Future prospects for the analogue gravity programme also look promising, both on the experimental front (where technology is rapidly advancing) and on the theoretical front (where variants of analogue models can be used as a springboard for radical attacks on the problem of quantum gravity).},

In a recent work, the first two authors proposed a so-called Hamiltonian regularisation for nonlinear shallow water and isentropic Euler equations. The characteristic property of this method is that the regularisation of solutions is achieved without adding any artificial dissipation or dispersion. The regularised system possesses a Hamiltonian structure and, thus, formally preserves the corresponding energy functional. In the present article we generalise this approach to shallow water waves over general, possibly time-dependent, bottoms. The proposed system is solved numerically with continuous Galerkin method and its solutions are compared with the analogous solutions of the classical shallow water and dispersive Serre-Green-Naghdi equations. The numerical results confirm the absence of dispersive and dissipative effects in presence of bathymetry variations.},

In our simulations, a landslide is presented as a quasi-deformable body moving along a curvilinear slope under action of the forces of gravity, buoyancy, water resistance and bottom friction. We employ the fully non-linear weakly dispersive model for tsunami wave simulations. The computations show that the initial landslide position on the real slope is extremely important for its dynamics and the wave generation process. We constructed some model landslides which generated similar waves to those observed. Moreover, these landslides stopped in the same region. Finally, we evaluated the significance of the frequency dispersion effects in the simulations.},

Various methods such as the simulation method, the eigenfunction expansion, numerical integration, the variational method, and the matrix continued-fraction method are discussed. This is the first time that this last method, which is very effective in dealing with simple Fokker-Planck equations having two variables, appears in a textbook. The methods of solution are applied to the statistics of a simple laser model and to Brownian motion in potentials. Such Brownian motion is important in solid-state physics, chemical physics and electric circuit theory. This new study edition is meant as a text for graduate students in physics, chemical physics, and electrical engineering.},

The solution is expressed in terms of the initial PDF and the wave action spectrum satisfying the wave-kinetic equation. We establish that, in the absence of wave breaking, the wave statistics converge to a Gaussian distribution in forced-dissipated wave systems while approaching a steady state. Also, we find that in non-stationary systems, if the statistic is Gaussian initially, it will remain Gaussian for all time. Generally, if the statistic is not initially Gaussian, it will remain non-Gaussian over the characteristic nonlinear evolution time of the wave spectrum. In freely decaying wave turbulence, substantial deviations from Gaussianity may persist infinitely long.},

Single-variable dissipative dynamical systems (like the single-transistor flip-flop) can only possess point attractors. Two-variable systems (like an LC-oscillator) can possess a one-dimensional attractor (limit cycle). Three-variable systems admit two even more complicated types of behavior: a toroidal attractor (of doughnut shape) and a chaotic attractor (which looks like an infinitely often folded sheet). The latter is easier to obtain. In four variables, we analogously have the hyper-toroidal and the hyper-chaotic attractor, respectively; and so forth. In every higher-dimensional case, all of the lower forms are also possible as well as “mixed cases” (like a combined hypertoroidal and chaotic motion, for example). Ten simple ordinary differential equations, most of them easy to implement electronically, are presented to illustrate the hierarchical tree. A second tree, in which one more dimension is needed for every type, is called the weak hierarchy because the chaotic regimes contained cannot be detected physically and numerically. The relationship between the two hierarchies is posed as an open question. It may be approached empirically - using electronic systems, for example.},

Here we analyze the stability of the synchronization of a network of oscillators coupled through different variables. Under the assumption of an equal topology of connections for all variables, the master stability function formalism allows assessing and quantifying the stability properties of the synchronization manifold when the coupling is transferred from one variable to another. We report on the existence of an optimal coupling transference that maximizes the stability of the synchronous state in a network of Rössler-like oscillators. Finally, we design an experimental implementation (using nonlinear electronic circuits) which grounds the robustness of the theoretical predictions against parameter mismatches, as well as against intrinsic noise of the system.},

We take advantage of experimental data collection of different wave types (single pulses, sinusoidal waves, bi-harmonic waves, and frequency modulated wave trains) and simulate their run-up using two models: (i) nondispersive nonlinear shallow water theory and (ii) dispersive Boussinesq-type model based on the modified Peregrine system. It is shown, that for long positive pulses, dispersive effects are not so important and nonlinear shallow water theory can be used. However, for periodic sinusoidal and bi-harmonic pulses of the same period, the dispersive effects result in significant wave transformation during its propagation but do not have a strong impact on its maximal run-up height. Overall, for maximum wave run-up height, we could not find a preference of dispersive model against the nondispersive one, and, therefore, suggest using nonlinear shallow water model for longwave run-up height estimation.},

The behavior of the mixture is described through a single mass density and a velocity field, with an unusual constraint that relates the divergence of the velocity to derivatives of the density. We discuss a derivation of the model from a Eulerian-Lagrangian description of the mixture. We propose a numerical scheme based on a hybrid Finite Volume/Finite Element method. This approach is validated by comparison to analytical solutions, numerical solutions and experimental data. The scheme works on unstructured meshes and it can be advantageously coupled to mesh refinements strategies in order to follow fronts of high density variation.

   abstract = {The estimate of an individual wave run-up is especially important for tsunami warning and risk assessment, as it allows for evaluating the inundation area. Here, as a model of tsunamis, we use the long single wave of positive polarity. The period of such a wave is rather long, which makes it different from the famous Korteweg-de Vries soliton. This wave nonlinearly deforms during its propagation in the ocean, which results in a steep wave front formation. Situations in which waves approach the coast with a steep front are often observed during large tsunamis, e.g. the 2004 Indian Ocean and 2011 Tohoku tsunamis. Here we study the nonlinear deformation and run-up of long single waves of positive polarity in the conjoined water basin, which consists of the constant depth section and a plane beach. The work is performed numerically and analytically in the framework of the nonlinear shallow-water theory. Analytically, wave propagation along the constant depth section and its run up on a beach are considered independently without taking into account wave interaction with the toe of the bottom slope. The propagation along the bottom of constant depth is described by the Riemann wave, while the wave run-up on a plane beach is calculated using rigorous analytical solutions of the nonlinear shallow-water theory following the Carrier-Greenspan approach. Numerically, we use the finite-volume method with the second-order UNO2 reconstruction in space and the third-order Runge-Kutta scheme with locally adaptive time steps. During wave propagation along the constant depth section, the wave becomes asymmetric with a steep wave front. It is shown that the maximum run-up height depends on the front steepness of the incoming wave approaching the toe of the bottom slope. The corresponding formula for maximum run-up height, which takes into account the wave front steepness, is proposed.},

   abstract = {The reliability of mathematical models for heat and mass transfer in building porous material is of capital importance. A reliable model permits to carry predictions of the physical phenomenon with sufficient confidence in the results. Among the physical phenomena, the hysteresis effects on moisture sorption and moisture capacity need to be integrated in the mathematical model of transfer. This article proposes to explore the use of an smooth Bang–Bang model to simulate the hysteresis effects coupled with heat and mass transfer in porous material. This model adds two supplementary differential equations to the two classical ones for heat and mass transfer. The solution of these equations ensures smooth transitions between the main sorption and desorption curves. Two parameters are required to control the speed of transition through the intermediary curves. After the mathematical description of the model, an efficient numerical model is proposed to compute the fields with accuracy and reduced computational efforts. It is based on the Du Fort–Frankel scheme for the heat and mass balance equations. For the hysteresis numerical model, an innovative implicit–explicit approach is proposed. Then, the predictions of the numerical model are compared with experimental observations from literature for two case studies. The first one corresponds to a slow cycle of adsorption and desorption while the second is based on a fast cycling case with alternative increase and decrease of moisture content. The comparisons highlight a very satisfactory agreement between the numerical predictions and the observations. In the last Section, the reliability and efficiency of the proposed model is investigated for long term simulation cases. The importance of considering hysteresis effects in the reliability of the predictions are enhanced by comparison with classical approaches from literature.},

   abstract = {Abstract. Many of the world's active volcanoes are situated on or near coastlines. During eruptions, diverse geophysical mass flows, including pyroclastic flows, debris avalanches, and lahars, can deliver large volumes of unconsolidated debris to the ocean in a short period of time and thereby generate tsunamis. Deposits of both hot and cold volcanic mass flows produced by eruptions of Aleutian arc volcanoes are exposed at many locations along the coastlines of the Bering Sea, North Pacific Ocean, and Cook Inlet, indicating that the flows entered the sea and in some cases may have initiated tsunamis. We evaluate the process of tsunami generation by cold granular subaerial volcanic mass flows using examples from Augustine Volcano in southern Cook Inlet. Augustine Volcano is the most historically active volcano in the Cook Inlet region, and future eruptions, should they lead to debris-avalanche formation and tsunami generation, could be hazardous to some coastal areas. Geological investigations at Augustine Volcano suggest that as many as 12&ndash;14 debris avalanches have reached the sea in the last 2000 years, and a debris avalanche emplaced during an A.D. 1883 eruption may have initiated a tsunami that was observed about 80 km east of the volcano at the village of English Bay (Nanwalek) on the coast of the southern Kenai Peninsula. Numerical simulation of mass-flow motion, tsunami generation, propagation, and inundation for Augustine Volcano indicate only modest wave generation by volcanic mass flows and localized wave effects. However, for east-directed mass flows entering Cook Inlet, tsunamis are capable of reaching the more populated coastlines of the southwestern Kenai Peninsula, where maximum water amplitudes of several meters are possible.},

   abstract = {In recent years, the Northern Hemisphere has suffered several devastating regional summer weather extremes, such as the European heat wave in 2003, the Russian heat wave and the Indus river flood in Pakistan in 2010, and the heat wave in the United States in 2011. Here, we propose a common mechanism for the generation of persistent longitudinal planetary-scale high-amplitude patterns of the atmospheric circulation in the Northern Hemisphere midlatitudes. Those patterns - with zonal wave numbers m = 6, 7, or 8 - are characteristic of the above extremes. We show that these patterns might result from trapping within midlatitude waveguides of free synoptic waves with zonal wave numbers k ≈ m. Usually, the quasistationary dynamical response with the above wave numbers m to climatological mean thermal and orographic forcing is weak. Such midlatitude waveguides, however, may favor a strong magnification of that response through quasiresonance.},

Here we show that a considerable part of these extremes were accompanied by highly magnified quasistationary midlatitude planetary waves with zonal wave numbers m = 6, 7, and 8. We further show that resonance conditions for these planetary waves were, in many cases, present before the onset of high-amplitude wave events, with a lead time up to 2 wk, suggesting that quasiresonant amplification (QRA) of these waves had occurred. Our results support earlier findings of an important role of the QRA mechanism in amplifying planetary waves, favoring recent NH weather extremes.},

Also discussed are applications of KAM theory (especially to celestial mechanics and statistical mechanics) and the parts of mathematics and physics in which KAM theory resides (dynamical systems, classical mechanics, and Hamiltonian perturbation theory).Although a number of sources on KAM theory are now available for experts, this book attempts to fill a long-standing gap at a more descriptive level. It stands out very clearly from existing publications on KAM theory because it leads the reader through an accessible account of the theory and places it in its proper context in mathematics, physics, and the history of science.},

We consider problems where the singularity occurs at a point, and where typical scales of the solution shrink to zero as the singularity is approached. Upon a similarity transformation, exact self-similar behaviour is mapped to the fixed point of a infinite dimensional dynamical system representing the original dynamics. We show that the dynamics close to the fixed point is a useful way classifying the structure of the singularity. Specifically, we consider various types of stable and unstable fixed points, centre-manifold dynamics, limit cycles, and chaotic dynamics.},

She was known for her work on partial differential equations (especially Hilbert's 19th problem) and fluid dynamics. She provided the first rigorous proofs of the convergence of a finite difference method for the Navier-Stokes equations. This is a revised and updated edition of a book of fundamental importance in the rigorous theory of solutions of the Navier-Stokes equations. The author considers the questions of their existence and uniqueness when satisfying appropriate boundary conditions. For this purpose she extends the class of permissible functions from the infinitely differentiable class (classical solutions) to a class of generalized functions defined in the distributional sense. Thus existence of solution in the new class is a necessary but not sufficient condition for existence in the classical sense. Linear and non-linear, steady and unsteady forms of the equations and both finite and infinite domains are all considered: in each type of problem important theorems are established in the course of which many new ideas and methods are developed. The book is strongly recommended to mathematicians interested in modern analysis and the rigorous theory of fluid mechanics.},

We review some recent theoretical and computational studies which show that there is a subtle dynamic depletion of nonlinear vortex stretching due to local geometric regularity of vortex filaments. We also investigate the dynamic stability of the 3D Navier-Stokes equations and the stabilizing effect of convection. A unique feature of our approach is the interplay between computation and analysis. Guided by our local non-blow-up theory, we have performed large-scale computations of the 3D Euler equations using a novel pseudo-spectral method on some of the most promising blow-up candidates. Our results show that there is tremendous dynamic depletion of vortex stretching. Moreover, we observe that the support of maximum vorticity becomes severely flattened as the maximum vorticity increases and the direction of the vortex filaments near the support of maximum vorticity is very regular. Our numerical observations in turn provide valuable insight, which leads to further theoretical breakthrough. Finally, we present a new class of solutions for the 3D Euler and Navier-Stokes equations, which exhibit very interesting dynamic growth properties. By exploiting the special nonlinear structure of the equations, we prove nonlinear stability and the global regularity of this class of solutions.},

   abstract = {In recent years, the theory of Borel summability or multisummability of divergent power series of one variable has been established and it has been proved that every formal solution of an ordinary differential equation with irregular singular point is multisummable. For partial differential equations the summability problem for divergent solutions has not been studied so well, and in this paper we shall try to develop the Borel summability of divergent solutions of the Cauchy problem of the complex heat equation, since the heat equation is a typical and an important equation where we meet diveregent solutions. In conclusion, the Borel summability of a formal solution is characterized by an analytic continuation property together with its growth condition of Cauchy data to infinity along a stripe domain, and the Borel sum is nothing but the solution given by the integral expression by the heat kernel. We also give new ways to get the heat kernel from the Borel sum by taking a special Cauchy data.},

   abstract = {In this paper we give a review on the computational methods used to capture and characterize the complex singularities developed by some relevant PDEs. We begin by reviewing the classical singularity tracking method and give an example of application using the Burgers equation as a case study. This method is based on the analysis of the Fourier spectrum of the solution and it allows to determine and characterize the complex singularity closest to the real domain. We then introduce other methods generally used to detect the hidden singularities. In particular we show some applications of the Padé approximation, of the Kida method, and of Borel-Polya method. We apply these techniques to the study of the singularity formation of some nonlinear dispersive and dissipative one dimensional PDE, of the 2D Prandtl equation and of the 2D Kadomtsev-Petviashvili equation. Finally the complex singularity analysis is applied to viscous high Reynolds number incompressible flows in the case of interaction with a rigid wall, and in the case of the vortex layers.},

   abstract = {The theory of exact resonances (kinematics and dynamics) is well developed while even the very concept of detuned resonance is ambiguous and only studies of their kinematic characteristics (that is, those not depending on time) are available in the literature. In this paper, we report novel effects enforced by the resonance detuning on solutions of the dynamical system describing interactions of three spherical planetary waves. We establish that the energy variation range can significantly exceed the range of the exact resonance for suitably chosen values of the detuning. The asymmetry of system’s solutions with respect to the sign of the detuning parameter is demonstrated. Finally, a non-monotonic dependence of the energy oscillation period with respect to detuning magnitude is discovered. These results have direct implications in physics of atmosphere, e.g., for prediction of weather extremes in the Northern Hemisphere midlatitudes (Proc. Nat. Acad. Sci. USA 2016, 133(25), 6862-6867). Moreover, similar study can be conducted for a generic three-wave system taken in the Hamiltonian form which makes our results applicable for an arbitrary Hamiltonian three-wave system met in climate prediction theory, geophysical fluid dynamics, plasma physics, etc.},

The mathematical formulations are derived based on a higher‐order perturbation analysis using the expanded form of velocity components. A sixth‐order multi‐step finite difference method is applied for spatial discretization and a sixth‐order Runge-Kutta method is applied for temporal discretization of the higher‐order depth‐integrated governing equations and boundary conditions. The present model is validated using available three‐dimensional experimental data and a good agreement is obtained. Moreover, the present higher‐order model is compared with fully potential three‐dimensional models as well as Boussinesq‐type multi‐layer models in several cases and the differences are discussed. The high accuracy of the present numerical model in considering the nonlinearity effects and frequency dispersion of waves is proven particularly for waves generated in intermediate and deeper water area.},

   abstract = {Multilayer nonhydrostatic models have gained popularity in the computation of ocean wave processes, but a recent attempt to make a connection to the Boussinesq-type approach raises some fundamental issues that require a rigorous assessment beyond the conventional framework of approximation. Such an endeavor is readily feasible for depth-integrated nonhydrostatic models because of the existence of an equivalent Boussinesq form. An examination of the governing equations shows that defining the nonhydrostatic pressure at layer interfaces for depth integration gives rise to a leading-order approximation of the dispersion relation distinct from the Taylor-series expansion. Introducing a parameterized nonhydrostatic pressure profile or increasing the number of layers is akin to retaining high-order terms in the Boussinesq-type equations with comparable rational function approximations of linear and nonlinear wave properties. Although both approaches converge to the exact solution at high order, the spatial derivatives in nonhydrostatic models always remain at first order. The simple numerical framework along with grid refinement techniques enable application of a single model over a wide range of spatial scales for practical application.},

   abstract = {Properties of solitary waves propagating in a two-layer fluid are investigated comparing experiments and theory. In the experiments the velocity field induced by the waves, the propagation speed and the wave shape are quite accurately measured using particle tracking velocimetry (PTV) and image analysis. The experiments are calibrated with a layer of fresh water above a layer of brine. The depth of the brine is 4.13 times the depth of the fresh water. Theoretical results are given for this depth ratio, and, in addition, in a few examples for larger ratios, up to 100 / 1. The wave amplitudes in the experiments range from a small value up to almost maximal amplitude. The thickness of the pycnocline is in the range of approximately 0.13 - 0.26 times the depth of the thinner layer. Solitary waves are generated by releasing a volume of fresh water trapped behind a gate. By careful adjustment of the length and depth of the initial volume we always generate a single solitary wave, even for very large volumes. The experiments are very repeatable and the recording technique is very accurate. The error in the measured velocities non-dimensionalized by the linear long wave speed is less than about 7 - 8% in all cases. The experiments are compared with a fully nonlinear interface model and weakly nonlinear Korteweg-de Vries (KdV) theory. The fully nonlinear model compares excellently with the experiments for all quantities measured. This is true for the whole amplitude range, even for a pycnocline which is not very sharp. The KdV theory is relevant for small wave amplitude but exhibit a systematic deviation from the experiments and the fully nonlinear theory for wave amplitudes exceeding about 0.4 times the depth of the thinner layer. In the experiments with the largest waves, rolls develop behind the maximal displacement of the wave due to the Kelvin-Helmholtz instability. The recordings enable evaluation of the local Richardson number due to the flow in the pycnocline. We find that stability or instability of the flow occurs in approximate agreement with the theorem of Miles and Howard.},

Here this initial value problem is considered within the context of the Ostrovsky, or the rotation-modified Korteweg-de Vries (KdV), equation and a numerical method for obtaining accurate wavepacket solutions is presented. The flow evolutions are described in the regimes of relatively-strong and relatively-weak rotational effects. When rotational effects are relatively strong a second-order soliton solution of the nonlinear Schrödinger equation accurately predicts the shape, and phase and group velocities of the numerically determined wavepackets. It is suggested that these solitons may form from a local Benjamin-Feir instability in the inertia-gravity wave-train radiated when a KdV solitary wave rapidly adjusts to the presence of strong rotation. When rotational effects are relatively weak the initial KdV solitary wave remains coherent longer, decaying only slowly due to weak radiation and modulational instability is no longer relevant. Wavepacket solutions in this regime appear to consist of a modulated KdV soliton wavetrain propagating on a slowly varying background of finite extent.},

Completely integrable nonlinear partial differential equations arise at various levels of approximation in shallow water theory. Such equations possess soliton solutions-coherent (spatially localized) structures that interact nonlinearly among themselves and then re-emerge, retaining their identity and showing particle-like scattering behavior. This chapter discusses a newly discovered, completely integrable dispersive shallow-water equation found by Camassa and Holm in 1993. This equation is obtained by using a small-wave-amplitude asymptotic expansion directly in the Hamiltonian for the vertically averaged incompressible Euler's equations, after substituting a solution ansatz of columnar fluid motion and restricting to an invariant manifold for unidirectional motion of waves at the free surface under the influence of gravity. Section II of the chapter derives the one-dimensional Green-Naghdi equations. Section III uses Hamiltonian methods to newly discovered equation for unidirectional waves. Section IV analyzes the behavior of the solutions of the equation and shows that certain initial conditions develop a vertical slope in finite time. It is also shown that there exist stable multisoliton solutions. Section V demonstrates the existence of an infinite number of conservation laws for the equation that follow from its bi-Hamiltonian property.},

In this method, the derived Galerkin expansion minimizes the residual like POD, but with the power balance equation for the resolved turbulent kinetic energy as an additional optimization constraint. Thus, the projection of the Navier-Stokes equation on to the expansion modes yields a Galerkin system that respects the power balance on the attractor. The resulting dynamical system requires no stabilizing eddy-viscosity term - contrary to other POD models of high-Reynolds-number flows. The proposed Galerkin method is illustrated with two test cases: two-dimensional flow inside a square lid-driven cavity and a two-dimensional mixing layer. Generalizations for more Navier-Stokes constraints, e.g. Reynolds equations, can be achieved in straightforward variation of the presented results.},

Recently the above theory has been extended to equations in two spatial and one temporal dimensions. In particular, the multidimensional analogue of the operator Φ has been found and its bi‐Hamiltonian factorization has been established. The above and other aspects of integrable equations, including mastersymmetries, are reviewed in this manuscript.

Our principal focus is the traveling-wave solutions called solitary waves, and three aspects will be investigated. A constructive proof of the existence of these waves together with a proof of their stability is developed. Continuation methods are used to generate a scheme capable of numerically approximating these solitary waves. The computer-generated approximations reveal detailed aspects of the structure of these waves. They are symmetric about their crests, but unlike the classical Korteweg-de Vries solitary waves, they feature a finite number of oscillations. The derivation of the equation is also revisited to get an idea of whether or not these oscillatory waves might actually occur in a natural setting.},

This system is a consistent discretisation of the incompressible Euler equations, valid without assumptions on the slopes of the interfaces. Expressed as a set of conservation laws for each layer, the formulation has a clear physical interpretation and makes a seamless link between the hydrostatic Saint-Venant equations, dispersive Boussinesq-style models and the incompressible Euler equations. The associated numerical scheme, based on an approximate vertical projection and multigrid-accelerated column relaxations, provides accurate and efficient solutions for all regimes. The same model can thus be applied to study metre-scale waves, even beyond breaking, with results closely matching those obtained using small-scale Euler/Navier-Stokes models, and coastal or global scale dispersive waves, with an accuracy and efficiency comparable to extended Boussinesq wave models. The implementation is adaptive, parallel and open source as part of the Basilisk framework and the documented source codes sufficient to reproduce all results and figures are provided.},

The grid system is straightforward to implement and no data structure is needed to store grid information. The present model is validated by applying it to simulate three laboratory-scale test cases of tsunami propagation over uneven beds and finally used to reproduce the 2011 Tohoku tsunami in Japan.

   abstract = {In the Ionian Sea (Central Mediterranean Sea), several thick acoustically transparent layers are present including the Augias deposit. The Augias deposit is the most recent, thick layer covering the entire floor of the Ionian Abyssal Plain with an average thickness of 10-12 m and a maximum thickness of up to 24 m in the Sirte Abyssal Plain. This deposit has also been observed in several adjacent smaller basins in waters deeper than 3000 m. Its estimated volume is > 65 km3. There are multiple plausible hypotheses regarding its age and triggering event, which include the 1600 BC Santorini volcanic caldera collapse, the 365 AD Crete M 8.5 earthquake and other smaller earthquakes such as the 374 AD Calabria M 6.3 earthquake and the 361 AD Sicily M 6.6 earthquake. Understanding the cause of this mass-transport deposit is crucial for improving the natural hazard assessment of a vast area between southern Italy and western Greece. In this study, we propose a new interpretation of the Augias deposit in terms of sedimentary processes and origin, based on sediment cores collected in the NW Ionian Sea during the CIRCEE cruise onboard R/V Le Suroit in October 2013.},

@article{Seibert2020,
   abstract = {The Lesser Antilles arc is a mixed siliciclastic and carbonate active margin made of active volcanic and flat Plio-Quaternary carbonate islands. It was built as a result of a complex tectonic history at the slowly converging boundary between the American plates and the Caribbean plate. The sedimentary processes as a consequence of external forcing (earthquakes, volcanism, hurricanes) were rarely documented in such environment and are poorly understood. We exploited an exceptional dataset of high-resolution marine seafloor data acquired during the last 20 years in the northern part of the Lesser Antilles forearc to document the sediment-transport processes. We achieved a detailed morpho-sedimentary study from multi-beam bathymetry, backscattering, and seismic profiles. Two areas could be characterized: 1) the “Rough Area”, along Barbuda to Guadeloupe carbonated islands, characterized by steep (up to 25°) slopes incised by short canyons, and deep basins controlled by major normal faults; 2) the “Channelized Area”, south of Guadeloupe and bordered by active volcanic islands and carbonate platforms, characterized by gentle slopes incised by long canyons. During sea-level high-stands, the sediment seems exported from the carbonate platform by hurricanes or density cascading but appears to settle at the shelf-edge and canyon heads. During sea-level low-stands, a connection may exist between onshore and offshore systems. However, this sediment supply appears not sufficient to generate canyon formation, likely shaped by regressive processes. Shelf breaks of the carbonate banks, platforms and submarine slopes are affected by sediment failures. Some may be associated to voluminous remobilizations and large mass transport deposits. Large earthquakes are likely the main processes in this area to remobilize sediments toward the deep forearc basins by triggering both slope failures and flushing of the canyon heads.},

This paper aims at estimating the sorption isotherm coefficients of a wood fiber material using experimental data. First, the mathematical model, based on convective transport of moisture, the Optimal Experiment Design (OED) and the experimental set-up are presented. Then, measurements of relative humidity within the material are carried out, after searching the OED using the computation of the sensitivity functions and a priori values of the unknown parameters. It enables to plan the experimental conditions in terms of sensor positioning and boundary conditions out of 20 possible designs, ensuring the best accuracy for the identification method and, thus, for the estimated parameter. After the measurements, the parameter estimation problem is solved. The determined sorption isotherm coefficients calibrate the numerical model to fit better the experimental data. However, some discrepancies still appear since the hysteresis effects on the sorption capacity are not included in the model. Therefore, the latter is improved proposing an additional differential equation for the sorption capacity to consider the hysteresis effects. The OED approach is developed for the estimation of five of the coefficients involved in the hysteresis model. To conclude, the prediction of the model with hysteresis have better reliability when compared to the experimental observations.},

More precisely, we will define the quantity types of finite volume such as up-wind scheme, HLL flux, well balanced scheme with hydrostatic reconstruction that are used in the numerical resolution of the variational problem. To this end we will consider a particular rectangular structured isotropic domain using P1 finite element space. We note that in other situations, for example with unstructured anisotropic mesh or with other type of finite element space, an approach of Discontinuous Galerkin method could be used. We note also that, there is a FreeVol project in order to introduce Finite Volume technic in FreeFem++ for hyperbolic PDEs by Frédéric Hecht et al. which is an ongoing work.},

   abstract = {© 2018 John Wiley  &  Sons, Ltd. This work presents an efficient numerical method based on spectral expansions for simulation of heat and moisture diffusive transfers through multilayered porous materials. Traditionally, by using the finite-difference approach, the problem is discretized in time and space domains (method of lines) to obtain a large system of coupled ordinary differential equations (ODEs), which is computationally expensive. To avoid such a cost, this paper proposes a reduced-order method that is faster and accurate, using a much smaller system of ODEs. To demonstrate the benefits of this approach, three case studies are presented. The first one considers nonlinear heat and moisture transfer through one material layer. The second case, ie, highly nonlinear, imposes a high moisture content gradient, simulating a rain-like condition, over a two-layered domain, whereas the last one compares the numerical prediction against experimental data for validation purposes. Results show how the nonlinearities and the interface between materials are easily and naturally treated with the spectral reduced-order method. Concerning the reliability part, predictions show a good agreement with experimental results, which confirm robustness, calculation efficiency, and high accuracy of the proposed approach for predicting the coupled heat and moisture transfer through porous materials.},

Nevertheless, building insulation can generate high expenditures so that the selection of an optimum insulation thickness requires a detailed energy simulation as well as an economic analysis. In this way, the present study proposes an innovative non-uniform adaptive method to determine the optimal insulation thickness of external walls. First, the method is compared with a reference solution to properly understand the features of the method, which can provide high accuracy with less spatial nodes. Then, the adaptive method is used to simulate the transient heat conduction through the building envelope of buildings located in Brazil, where there is a large potential of energy reduction. Simulations have been efficiently carried out for different wall and roof configurations, showing that the innovative method efficiently provides a gain of 25% on the computer run time.},

   abstract = {Copyright © 2017, arXiv, All rights reserved. Implicit schemes require important sub-iterations when dealing with highly nonlinear problems such as the combined heat and moisture transfer through porous building elements. The computational cost rises significantly when the whole-building is simulated, especially when there is important coupling among the building elements themselves with neighbouring zones and with HVAC (Heating Ventilation and Air Condi-tioning) systems. On the other hand, the classical Euler explicit scheme is generally not used because its stability condition imposes very fine time discretisation. Hence, this pa-per explores the use of an improved explicit approach-the Dufort-Frankel scheme-to overcome the disadvantage of the classical explicit one and to bring benefits that cannot be obtained by implicit methods. The Dufort-Frankel approach is first com-pared to the classical Euler implicit and explicit schemes to compute the solution of nonlinear heat and moisture transfer through porous materials. Then, the analysis of the Dufort-Frankel unconditionally stable explicit scheme is extended to the coupled heat and moisture balances on the scale of a one- A nd a two-zone building models. The Dufort-Frankel scheme has the benefits of being unconditionally stable, second-order accurate in time O(Δt 2) and to compute explicitly the solution at each time step, avoiding costly sub-iterations. This approach may reduce the computational cost by twenty, as well as it may enable perfect synchronism for whole-building simulation and co-simulation.},

   abstract = {Copyright © 2019, arXiv, All rights reserved. This work presents a detailed mathematical model combined with an innovative efficient numerical model to predict heat, air and moisture transfer through porous building materials. The model considers the transient effects of air transport and its impact on the heat and moisture transfer. The achievement of the mathematical model is detailed in the continuity of Luikov's work. A system composed of two advection-diffusion differential equations plus one exclusively diffusion equation is derived. The main issue to take into account the transient air transfer arises in the very small characteristic time of the transfer, implying very fine discretisation. To circumvent these difficulties, the numerical model is based on the Du Fort-Frankel explicit and unconditionally stable scheme for the exclusively diffusion equation. It is combined with a two-step Runge-Kutta scheme in time with the Scharfetter-Gummel numerical scheme in space for the coupled advection-diffusion equations. At the end, the numerical model enables to relax the stability condition, and, therefore, to save important computational efforts. A validation case is considered to evaluate the efficiency of the model for a nonlinear problem. Results highlight a very accurate solution computed about 16 times faster than standard approaches. After this numerical validation, the reliability of the mathematical model is evaluated by comparing the numerical predictions to experimental observations. The latter is measured within a multi-layered wall submitted to a sudden increase of vapor pressure on the inner side and driven climate boundary conditions on the outer side. A very satisfactory agreement is noted between the numerical predictions and experimental observations indicating an overall good reliability of the proposed model.},

Comparisons of experimental observation of heat and moisture transfer through porous building materials with numerical results have been presented in numerous studies reported in literature. However, some discrepancies have been observed, highlighting underestimation of sorption process and overestimation of desorption process. Some studies intend to explain the discrepancies by analysing the importance of hysteresis effects as well as carrying out sensitivity analyses on the input parameters as convective transfer coefficients. This article intends to investigate the accuracy and efficiency of the coupled solution by adding advective transfer of both heat and moisture in the physical model. In addition, the efficient Scharfetter and Gummel numerical scheme is proposed to solve the system of advection-diffusion equations, which has the advantages of being well-balanced and asymptotically preserving. Moreover, the scheme is particularly efficient in terms of accuracy and reduction of computational time when using large spatial discretisation parameters. Several linear and non-linear cases are studied to validate the method and highlight its specific features. At the end, an experimental benchmark from the literature is considered. The numerical results are compared to the experimental data for a pure diffusive model and also for the proposed model. The latter presents better agreement with the experimental data. The influence of the hysteresis effects on the moisture capacity is also studied, by adding a third differential equation.},

It is of great concern to produce numerically efficient methods for moisture diffusion through porous media, capable of accurately calculate moisture distribution with a reduced computational effort. In this way, model reduction methods are promising approaches to bring a solution to this issue since they do not degrade the physical model and provide a significant reduction of computational cost. Therefore, this article explores in details the capabilities of two model-reduction techniques - the Spectral Reduced-Order Model (Spectral-ROM) and the Proper Generalised Decomposition (PGD) - to numerically solve moisture diffusive transfer through porous materials. Both approaches are applied to three different problems to provide clear examples of the construction and use of these reduced-order models. The methodology of both approaches is explained extensively so that the article can be used as a numerical benchmark by anyone interested in building a reduced-order model for diffusion problems in porous materials. Linear and non-linear unsteady behaviors of unidimensional moisture diffusion are investigated. The last case focuses on solving a parametric problem in which the solution depends on space, time and the diffusivity properties. Results have highlighted that both methods provide accurate solutions and enable to reduce significantly the order of the model around ten times lower than the large original model. It also allows an efficient computation of the physical phenomena with an error lower than 10-2when compared to a reference solution.},

This work presents an alternative view on the numerical simulation of diffusion processes applied to the heat and moisture transfer through porous building materials. Traditionally, by using the finite-difference approach, the discretization follows the Method Of Lines (MOL), when the problem is first discretized in space to obtain a large system of coupled Ordinary Differential Equations (ODEs). Thus, this paper proposes to change this viewpoint. First, we discretize in time to obtain a small system of coupled ODEs, which means instead of having a Cauchy (Initial Value) Problem (IVP), we have a Boundary Value Problem (BVP). Fortunately, BVPs can be solved efficiently today using adaptive collocation methods of high order. To demonstrate the benefits of this new approach, three case studies are presented, in which one of them is compared with experimental data. The first one considers nonlinear heat and moisture transfer through one material layer while the second one considers two material layers. Results show how the nonlinearities and the interface between materials are easily treated, by reasonably using a fourth-order adaptive method. Finally, the last case study compares numerical results with experimental measurements, showing a good agreement.},

The fidelity of a model relies both on its accuracy to predict the physical phenomena and its capability to estimate unknown parameters using observations. This article focuses on this second aspect by analyzing the reliability of two mathematical models proposed in the literature for the simulation of heat losses through building walls. The first one, named DF, is the classical heat diffusion equation combined with the Du Fort–Frankel numerical scheme. The second is the so-called RC lumped approach, based on a simple ordinary differential equation to compute the temperature within the wall. The reliability is evaluated following a two stages method. First, samples of observations are generated using a pseudo-spectral numerical model for the heat diffusion equation with known input parameters. The results are then modified by adding a noise to simulate experimental measurements. Then, for each sample of observation, the parameter estimation problem is solved using one of the two mathematical models. The reliability is assessed based on the accuracy of the approach to recover the unknown parameter. Three case studies are considered for the estimation of (i) the heat capacity, (ii) the thermal conductivity or (iii) the heat transfer coefficient at the interface between the wall and the ambient air. For all cases, the DF mathematical model has a very satisfactory reliability to estimate the unknown parameters without any bias. However, the RC model lacks of fidelity and reliability. The error on the estimated parameter can reach 40% for the heat capacity, 80% for the thermal conductivity and 450% for the heat transfer coefficient.},

A multifaceted approach is developed in this work to identify environmental conditions, primarily the coastal profiles, aiding in extreme wave run-ups. The near-shore bathymetry profile is approximated using a Gaussian process model. The latter is then used for simulation of waves using a finite-volume based numerical approach approximating nonlinear shallow water equations. Optimization is performed in the framework of Bayesian optimization which uses the generated information to build a surrogate model for the wave run-up objective function, and then uses an acquisition function to sequentially determine the next-best query point in its feature space. We show that certain bathymetry geometries can lead to resonant run-ups that are larger than known results of maximum run-up on a plane beach. Another mechanism, possibly resulting from the interaction of the trailing and the preceding bore, can also lead to extreme run-ups, although much lower in magnitude than in the resonant case. We also perform a few case-studies with N−waves, as well as on bathymetric conditions for least wave-run ups. Application of the approach in conceptual designing of coastal structures is also demonstrated.},

Predictions of physical phenomena in buildings are carried out by using physical models formulated as a mathematical problem and solved by means of numerical methods, aiming at evaluating, for instance, the building thermal or hygrothermal performance by calculating distributions and fluxes of heat and moisture transfer. Therefore, the choice of the numerical method is crucial since it is a compromise among \(i\) the solution accuracy, \(ii\) the computational cost to obtain the solution and \(iii\) the complexity of the method implementation. An efficient numerical method enables to compute an accurate solution with a minimum computational run time \(CPU\). On that account, this article brings an investigation on the performance of three numerical methods. The first one is the standard and widely used finite-difference approach, while the second one is the so-called RC approach, which is a particular method brought to the building physics area by means of an analogy of electric circuits. The third numerical method is the spectral one, which has been recently proposed to solve nonlinear diffusive problems in building physics. The three methods are evaluated in terms of accuracy on the assessment of the dependent variable \(temperature or vapor pressure\) or of density of fluxes for three different cases: i\) heat diffusion through a concrete slab, ii\) moisture diffusion through an aerated concrete slab and iii\) heat diffusion using measured temperatures as boundary conditions. Results highlight the spectral approach as the most accurate method.

The method is tested on the known examples from classical and quantum mechanics, and applied to the Latex Particles Morphology model, where it allows us to reduce the variation of the relevant coefficients from 49 to just 4 orders of magnitudes. The PBE are then solved by a novel Generalised Method Of Characteristics, and the OS is shown to help reduce numerical error, and avoid unphysical behaviour of the solution.

Its aim is to give an introduction to this rich and beautiful subject, while presenting methods from the theory of complex manifolds which, in the special case of one complex variable, turn out to be particularly elementary and transparent. The book is divided into three chapters. In the first chapter we consider Riemann surfaces as covering spaces and develop a few basics from topology which are needed for this. Then we construct the Riemann surfaces which arise via analytic continuation of function germs. In particular this includes the Riemann surfaces of algebraic functions. As well we look more closely at analytic functions which display a special multi-valued behavior. Examples of this are the primitives of holomorphic i-forms and the solutions of linear differential equations. The second chapter is devoted to compact Riemann surfaces. The main classical results, like the Riemann-Roch Theorem, Abel's Theorem and the Jacobi inversion problem, are presented. Sheaf cohomology is an important technical tool. But only the first cohomology groups are used and these are comparatively easy to handle. The main theorems are all derived, following Serre, from the finite dimensionality of the first cohomology group with coefficients in the sheaf of holomorphic functions. And the proof of this is based on the fact that one can locally solve inhomogeneous Cauchy­ Riemann equations and on Schwarz' Lemma.},

An analytical solution of deformation of a homogeneous, isotropic elastic layer of uniform thickness overlying a homogeneous, isotropic viscoelastic half-space of Burger medium due to movement of an infinite fault for different types of crack surface has been studied. The deformation by this fault has been compared with the deformation by an infinite fault situated in viscoelastic half-space of Burger medium. The expressions of displacement, stress and strain have been obtained in aseismic period (period in between two major seismic events) by using Green’s function technique and Laplace transform by applying suitable boundary conditions and initial conditions. Finally these displacement, stress and strain components are numerically computed with suitable values of the model parameters and the results thus obtained are presented graphically. A detailed study of these expressions may give some idea about the amount of displacement due to different types of fault movement and the nature of stress-strain accumulation across the earthquake fault. A Comparison of these results has also been analysed and the effect of change of inclinations and velocities of the fault movement has been studied. Such theoretical models may be used for obtaining greater insight into the earthquake processes in seismically active region.},

The Editors-in-Chief were alerted by a reader to a methodological issue affecting the main approach followed in the paper. The authors considered a vessel with an open top but closed at the bottom and the sides by solid walls. The authors introduced a nonzero velocity of a condensing component of a gas mixture, that has the same value everywhere and is directed towards the bottom of the vessel. This clearly violates the impermeability of the solid wall at the bottom of the vessel. The error is essential as the entire manuscript is set up as a proof of existence of this convection term. However, the fitting of the value of a velocity in a model to experimental data is not a proof of existence. A proper proof would require direct experimental measurements and/or evaluation based on the fundamental conservation laws. (a) Experimental validation would require direct velocity field or pressure gradient determination, either of which experimental data would prove that a nonzero net convection term introduced by the authors is correct. No such data are provided in the paper in question.(b) A derivation based on first principles is also not given in the paper. Although the authors attempted to give such a derivation in their answers to the Editors-in-Chief's comments, there is a serious error in each of their answers. For example, they state that Eq. (8) cannot hold at the bottom of the vessel, while both sides of Eq. (8) are simply equal to zero at this place (Eq. (8) is obtained by taking the derivative with respect to x of the Dalton equation which says that the sum of all partial pressures is the total pressure).The physical arguments why the total pressure in the vessel should be homogeneous in quasi-steady state are solid and the Editors-in-Chief have been provided with neither direct experimental measurements nor correct analytical proof to the contrary. After careful consideration, the Editors-in-Chief have decided that this article should be retracted.},

   abstract = {© 2019 IEEE. To perform visual data exploration, many dimensionality reduction methods have been developed. These tools allow data analysts to represent multidimensional data in a 2D or 3D space, while preserving as much relevant information as possible. Yet, they cannot preserve all structures simultaneously and they induce some unavoidable distortions. Hence, many criteria have been introduced to evaluate a map's overall quality, mostly based on the preservation of neighbourhoods. Such global indicators are currently used to compare several maps, which helps to choose the most appropriate mapping method and its hyperparameters. However, those aggregated indicators tend to hide the local repartition of distortions. Thereby, they need to be supplemented by local evaluation to ensure correct interpretation of maps.In this paper, we describe a new method, called MING, for "Map Interpretation using Neighbourhood Graphs". It offers a graphical interpretation of pairs of map quality indicators, as well as local evaluation of the distortions. This is done by displaying on the map the nearest neighbours graphs computed in the data space and in the embedding. Shared and unshared edges exhibit reliable and unreliable neighbourhood information conveyed by the mapping. By this mean, analysts may determine whether proximity (or remoteness) of points on the map faithfully represents similarity (or dissimilarity) of original data, within the meaning of a chosen map quality criteria. We apply this approach to two pairs of widespread indicators: precision/recall and trustworthiness/continuity, chosen for their wide use in the community, which will allow an easy handling by users.},

   abstract = {© 2020 Elsevier Masson SAS The reliability of mathematical models for heat and mass transfer in building porous material is of capital importance. A reliable model permits to carry predictions of the physical phenomenon with sufficient confidence in the results. Among the physical phenomena, the hysteresis effects on moisture sorption and moisture capacity need to be integrated in the mathematical model of transfer. This article proposes to explore the use of an smooth Bang–Bang model to simulate the hysteresis effects coupled with heat and mass transfer in porous material. This model adds two supplementary differential equations to the two classical ones for heat and mass transfer. The solution of these equations ensures smooth transitions between the main sorption and desorption curves. Two parameters are required to control the speed of transition through the intermediary curves. After the mathematical description of the model, an efficient numerical model is proposed to compute the fields with accuracy and reduced computational efforts. It is based on the Du Fort–Frankel scheme for the heat and mass balance equations. For the hysteresis numerical model, an innovative implicit–explicit approach is proposed. Then, the predictions of the numerical model are compared with experimental observations from literature for two case studies. The first one corresponds to a slow cycle of adsorption and desorption while the second is based on a fast cycling case with alternative increase and decrease of moisture content. The comparisons highlight a very satisfactory agreement between the numerical predictions and the observations. In the last Section, the reliability and efficiency of the proposed model is investigated for long term simulation cases. The importance of considering hysteresis effects in the reliability of the predictions are enhanced by comparison with classical approaches from literature.},

Two implicit assumptions which they also made were irrotational and inviscid fluids. Comparing experiment and observation seems to suggest that these two assumptions are well justified. This paper removes the assumption of irrotationality in the case of electrohydrodynamics with an assumption of globally constant vorticity in the fluid. A study of the effect of vorticity on wave profiles and amplitudes is made revealing some unusual features. The velocity potential is an important variable in irrotational flow; the vertical component of velocity takes place of this variable in our analysis. This allows the bypassing of the Burns condition and also demonstrates that waves exist even for negative values of the vorticity. The linear and weakly nonlinear models are derived.},

For the outer region, the propagation of an incident solitary wave and its subsequent wave reflection and transmission after the wave–body interaction are modeled by solving the generalized Boussinesq (gB) equations. Time variations of the wave profiles and hydrodynamic forces for various wave and structural conditions are computed. A series of experimental measurements of wave elevations were carried out for verification of the model performance. The wave elevations obtained from the model simulations are found to agree closely with the measured data. The parametric studies were performed to examine the effects of wave amplitude, structural submergence, and structural width on the transmitted and reflected waves. An increase of structural submergence results in a decrease of the transmitted wave amplitude. Also, with an increase in structural width, the transmitted wave amplitude decreases.},

A base-grid system is adopted in view of a transient curvilinear coordinate transformation along the vertical direction, while the horizontal coordinates remain uniformly distributed. To capture the variations of the free surface more accurately and effectively, the necessary denser grids can be specified within the vertically divided multi-plane layers near the free surface. In addition, fine grids can be arranged around the structures included in the flow domain. The model is first validated for the case of a solitary wave propagating along a narrow uniform-depth channel to investigate the level of solution improvement by the grid-refining technique. Smoothing is applied to remove the weak-fluctuation waves produced by the interpolation. In addition, the initial condition of the solitary wave is adjusted from the long-wave analytical solution to fit the presented fully nonlinear wave model. The results indicate that both efficiency and accuracy increase greatly by applying the fully nonlinear wave model as compared with a model using a uniformly non-refined grid system. Second, this model is applied to study a coastal problem related to a solitary wave diffracted by a surface-piercing square cylinder with or without a separating distance between the seabed and the bottom of the structure.},

The potential-flow–based finite difference model is generalized by solving the transformed equations in grids according to a vertically transient curvilinear coordinate system. The fully nonlinear conditions at the free surface are treated by a mixed explicit-implicit scheme to ensure numerical accuracy and stability. The wave elevations in terms of reflected and transmitted waves under various structural and wave conditions are computed and compared with those from a series of small-scale experimental tests. Good agreement for results of selected cases is also confirmed by comparison with other published experimental measurements and integrated analytical-numerical model (IANM) solutions. It is found that both the structural length and the positioned gap greatly affect the wave reflection, transmission, and wave runup at the front and rear walls of the structure. For a structure with more complex geometry, simulations of a solitary wave passing through a partially immersed body with an excavated bottom are also performed. The excavated zone is shown to suppress the transmission process of the incident waves.},

As the title suggests, the material covered here includes the Poisson and symplectic structures (Poisson manifolds, Poisson bi-vectors, and Poisson brackets), group actions and orbits (infinitesimal action, stabilizers, and adjoint representations), moment maps, Poisson and Hamiltonian actions. Finally, the phase space reduction is also discussed. The very last section introduces the Poisson-Lie structures along with some related notions. This text represents a brief review of a well-known material citing standard references for more details. The exposition is concise, but pedagogical. The authors believe that it will be useful as an introductory exposition for students interested in this specific topic.},

We perform local symmetry and conservation laws classification for this family of Partial Differential Equations (PDEs). The analysis reveals that this family includes a special equation which admits additional, higher-order local symmetries and conservation laws. We compute its solitary waves and simulate their collisions. The numerical simulations show that their collision is elastic, which is an indication of its S-integrability. This particular PDE turns out to be a rescaled version of the celebrated Camassa-Holm equation, which confirms its integrability.},

   abstract = {In recent times it has been stated that many dynamical systems of classical mathematical physics and mechanics are endowed with symplectic structures, given in the majority of cases by Poisson brackets. Very often such Poisson structures on corresponding manifolds are canonical, which gives rise to the possibility of producing their hidden group theoretical essence for many completely integrable dynamical systems. It is a well understood fact that great part of comprehensive integrability theories of nonlinear dynamical systems on manifolds is based on Lie-algebraic ideas, by means of which, in particular, the classification of such compatibly bi­ Hamiltonian and isospectrally Lax type integrable systems has been carried out. Many chapters of this book are devoted to their description, but to our regret so far the work has not been completed. Hereby our main goal in each analysed case consists in separating the basic algebraic essence responsible for the complete integrability, and which is, at the same time, in some sense universal, i.e., characteristic for all of them. Integrability analysis in the framework of a gradient-holonomic algorithm, devised in this book, is fulfilled through three stages: 1) finding a symplectic structure (Poisson bracket) transforming an original dynamical system into a Hamiltonian form; 2) finding first integrals (action variables or conservation laws); 3) defining an additional set of variables and some functional operator quantities with completely controlled evolutions (for instance, as Lax type representation).},

   abstract = {The propagation of flexural gravity waves, routinely used to model wave interaction with sea ice, is studied, including the effect of compression and current. A number of significant and surprising properties are shown to exist. The occurrence of blocking above a critical value of compression is illustrated. This is analogous to propagation of surface gravity waves in the presence of opposing current and light wave propagation in the curved space-time near a black hole, therefore providing a novel system for studying analogue gravity. Between the blocking and buckling limit of the compressive force, the dispersion relation possesses three positive real roots, contrary to an earlier observation of having a single positive real root. Negative energy waves, in which the phase and group velocity point in opposite directions, are also shown to exist. In the presence of an opposing current and certain critical ranges of compressive force, the second blocking point shifts from the positive to the negative branch of the dispersion relation. Such a shift is known as the Hawking effect from the analogous behaviour in the theory of relativity which leads to Hawking radiation. The theory we develop is illustrated with simulations of linear waves in the time domain.},

However, the proliferation of various Boussinesq-type systems started only in the second half of the XXst century. Today they come under various flavors depending on the goals of the modeler. At the beginning of the XXIst century an effort to classify such systems, at least for even bottoms, was undertaken and developed according to both different physical regimes and mathematical properties, with special emphasis, in this last sense, on the existence of symmetry groups and their connection to conserved quantities. Of particular interest are those systems admitting a symplectic structure, with the subsequent preservation of the total energy represented by the Hamiltonian. In the present paper a family of Boussinesq-type systems with multi-symplectic structure is introduced. Some properties of the new systems are analyzed: their relation with already known Boussinesq models, the identification of those systems with additional Hamiltonian structure as well as other mathematical features like well-posedness and existence of different types of solitary-wave solutions. The consistency of multi-symplectic systems with the full Euler equations is also discussed.},

   abstract = {Multisymplecticity and the variational bicomplex are two subjects which have developed independently. Our main observation is that re-analysis of multisymplectic systems from the view of the variational bicomplex not only is natural but also generates new fundamental ideas about multisymplectic Hamiltonian PDEs. The variational bicomplex provides a natural grading of differential forms according to their base and fibre components, and this structure generates a new relation between the geometry of the base, covariant multisymplectic PDEs and the conservation of symplecticity. Our formulation also suggests a new view of Noether theory for multisymplectic systems, leading to a definition of multimomentum maps that we apply to give a coordinate-free description of multisymplectic relative equilibria. Our principal example is the class of multisymplectic systems on the total exterior algebra bundle over a Riemannian manifold.},

This method is based on a reduced Hessian Krylov-Newton scheme applied to a norm-preserving discrete model of a dipole quantum control problem. The use of second-order numerical methods for solving the control problem is justified, proving the existence of optimal solutions and analyzing first- and second-order optimality conditions. Criteria for the discretization of the nonconvex optimization problem and for the formulation of the Hessian are given to ensure accurate gradients and a symmetric Hessian. Robustness of the Newton approach is obtained using a globalization strategy with a robust linesearch procedure. Results of numerical experiments demonstrate that the Newton approach presented in this paper is able to provide fast and accurate controls for high-energy state transitions.},

In each case, there is an infinite number of possibilities of vectors due to the unknown arbitrary functions and the variable coefficients for the considered model. We selected one case and examined the commutative product between multi unknown Lie infinitesimals for the (3 + 1) dimensional (VCKS) equation and this complicated process resulted from some new Lie vectors. The commutative product generates a system of nonlinear ODEs which had been solved manually. Through three stages of Lie symmetry reduction using the equivalence transformation, (VCKS) equation is reduced to solvable nonlinear ODEs using various combinations of optimal Lie vectors. By solving these ODEs, we investigate new analytical solutions for these ODEs. Back substituting to the original variables generates new solutions for (VCKS).

   abstract = {Dimensionality reduction enables analysts to perform visual exploration of multidimensional data with a low-dimensional map retaining as much as possible of the original data structure. The interpretation of such a map relies on the hypothesis of preservation of neighborhood relations. Namely, distances in the map are assumed to reflect faithfully dissimilarities in the data space, as measured with a domain-related metric. Yet, in most cases, this hypothesis is undermined by distortions of those relations by the mapping process, which need to be accounted for during map interpretation. In this paper, we describe an interpretative support method called Map Interpretation using Neighborhood Graphs (MING) displaying individual neighborhood relations on the map, as edges of nearest neighbors graphs. The level of distortion of those relations is shown through coloring of the edges. This allows analysts to assess the reliability of similarity relations inferred from the map, while hinting at the original structure of data by showing the missing relations. Moreover, MING provides a local interpretation for classical map quality indicators, since the quantitative measure of distortions is based on those indicators. Overall, the proposed method alleviates the mapping-induced bias in interpretation while constantly reminding users that the map is not the data.},

   abstract = {Nonlinear dimensionality reduction of high-dimensional data is challenging as the low-dimensional embedding will necessarily contain distortions, and it can be hard to determine which distortions are the most important to avoid. When annotation of data into known relevant classes is available, it can be used to guide the embedding to avoid distortions that worsen class separation. The supervised mapping method introduced in the present paper, called ClassNeRV, proposes an original stress function that takes class annotation into account and evaluates embedding quality both in terms of false neighbors and missed neighbors. ClassNeRV shares the theoretical framework of a family of methods descended from Stochastic Neighbor Embedding (SNE). Our approach has a key advantage over previous ones: in the literature supervised methods often emphasize class separation at the price of distorting the data neighbors' structure; conversely, unsupervised methods provide better preservation of structure at the price of often mixing classes. Experiments show that ClassNeRV can preserve both neighbor structure and class separation, outperforming nine state of the art alternatives.},

This study aims to review the recent activities on tsunami hazard in the Makran subduction zone with a focus on deterministic and probabilistic tsunami hazard assessments. While almost all studies focused on tsunami hazard from the Makran subduction thrust, other local sources such as splay faults and landslides can be also real threats in the future. Far-field tsunami sources such as Sumatra-Andaman and Java subduction zones, commonly lumped as the Sunda subduction zone, do not seem to pose a serious risk to the Makran coastlines. The tsunamigenic potential of the western segment of the MSZ should not be underestimated considering the new evidence from geological studies and lessons from past tsunamis in the world. An overview of the results of tsunami hazard studies shows that the coastal area between Kereti to Ormara along the shoreline of Iran-Pakistan and the coastal segment between Muscat and Sur along Oman’s shoreline are the most hazardous areas. Uncertainties in studying tsunami hazard for the Makran region are large. We recommend that future studies mainly focus on the role of thick sediments, a better understanding of the plates interface geometry, the source mechanism and history of extreme-wave deposits, the contribution of other local tsunamigenic sources and vulnerability assessment for all coastlines of the whole Makran region.</p>},

   abstract = {In this paper, statistical emulation is shown to be an essential tool for the end-to-end physical and numerical modelling of local tsunami impact, i.e. from the earthquake source to tsunami velocities and heights. In order to surmount the prohibitive computational cost of running a large number of simulations, the emulator, constructed using 300 training simulations from a validated tsunami code, yields 1 million predictions. This constitutes a record for any realistic tsunami code to date, and is a leap in tsunami science since high risk but low probability hazard thresholds can be quantified. For illustrating the efficacy of emulation, we map probabilistic representations of maximum tsunami velocities and heights at around 200 locations about Karachi port. The 1 million predictions comprehensively sweep through a range of possible future tsunamis originating from the Makran Subduction Zone (MSZ). We rigorously model each step in the tsunami life cycle: first use of the three-dimensional subduction geometry Slab2 in MSZ, most refined fault segmentation in MSZ, first sediment enhancements of seabed deformation (up to 60% locally) and bespoke unstructured meshing algorithm. Owing to the synthesis of emulation and meticulous numerical modelling, we also discover substantial local variations of currents and heights.},

The method features the use of implicit time integration schemes and is based on a consistent Newton–Raphson linearization. The performances are enhanced by using the Kou’s method (Kou et al., 2006) which features a third-order convergence behavior without requiring higher order derivatives. To overcome numerical instability issues related to the explicit decoupling, a fully monolithic strategy and a partitioned implicit strategy are devised. We investigate the main features of the proposed strategies, and we report several numerical experiments with the aim of illustrating their robustness and accuracy. We show numerically that the monolithic strategy performs better and remains stable when considering relatively small viscosities or large stiffness, for which the partitioned approach depicts a slow convergence or even fails to converge. However, the partitioned strategy features significant computational savings when it converges within a reasonable number of sub-iterations.},

In the beginning we recall what is known about the dynamic cascades for the classical KdV (quadratic) and mKdV (cubic) equations. Then, we investigate further the mKdV case by considering a richer set of initial perturbations in order to check the validity and persistence of various facts previously established for the narrow-banded perturbations. Afterwards we focus on higher order nonlinearities (quartic and quintic) which are found to be quite different in many respects from the mKdV equation. Throughout this study we consider both the direct and double energy cascades. It was found that the dynamic cascade is always formed, but its formation is not necessarily accompanied by the nonlinear stage of the modulational instability. The direct cascade structure remains invariant regardless of the size of the spectral domain. In contrast, the double cascade shape can depend on the size of the spectral domain, even if the total number of cascading modes remains invariant. The results obtained in this study can be potentially applied to plasmas, free surface and internal wave hydrodynamics.},

The flight trajectories should be optimal and stay in the UAV flight operational area. The maneuver planning is conducted in two steps, which are UAV path planning and UAV flight trajectory planning. For the first step, the Bezier curve is employed as a maneuvering path. The path planning optimization objective is to minimize the path length while satisfying maximum curvature and collision avoidance constraints. The flight trajectories optimization objective is to minimize maneuvering time and load factor considering, minimum/maximum speed, minimum/maximum acceleration, maximum roll angle, maximum turn rate, and aerodynamics constraints. The variable speed trajectory generation is developed within allowable speed zone considering these UAV flight constraints by employing meta-heuristic optimizations. Results show that the PSO have outperformed the GA and the GWO for both steps of path planning and trajectory planning. The variable speed has succeeded in reducing the load factor during the bank-turn mechanism using the Bezier curve. The variable speed is recommended to be conducted when the result of the maneuvering path involve the lower turning radius. A simultaneous on arrival target mission has also succeeded to be conducted using the combination of the variable speed and constant speed strategies.},

On the contrary, the proposed scheme is ‘well‐balanced’: it preserves equilibria of <italic>Q</italic>  = 0.

Palaeotsunamis play an essential role in understanding historical events and their consequences along with their return periods. Here, we focus on a palaeo event that occurred during the Younger Dryas to Early Holocene climatic transition, ca., 12,000 years ago in the Lake Aiguebelette (NW Alps, France). Based on high-resolution seismic and bathymetric surveys and sedimentological, geochemical, and magnetic analyses, a seismically induced large mass transport deposit with an initial volume of 767,000 m3 was identified, dated and mapped. To investigate whether this underwater mass transport produced a palaeotsunami in the Lake Aiguebelette, this research combines sedimentary records and numerical models. Numerical simulations of tsunamis are performed using a visco-plastic landslide model for tsunami source generation and two-dimensional depth-averaged nonlinear shallow water equations for tsunami wave propagation and inundation modelling. Our simulations conclude that this sublacustrine landslide produced a tsunami wave with a maximum amplitude of approximately 2 m and run-up heights of up to 3.6 m. The modelled sediment thickness resulting from this mass transport corroborates well with the event deposits mapped in the lake. Based on our results, we suggest that this sublacustrine mass transport generated a significant tsunami wave that has not been reported previously to the best of our knowledge.},

In this system, the magnons, i.e., collective spin excitations in the sphere, are coupled to the cavity photon mode via magnetic dipole interaction and to the phonon mode via magnetostrictive force (optomechanical-like). We employ the quantum phase-space formulation of the entropy change to evaluate the steady-state entropy production rate and associated quantum correlation in the system. We find that the behavior of the entropy flow between the cavity photon mode and the phonon mode is determined by the magnon-photon coupling and the cavity photon dissipation rate. Interestingly, the entropy production rate can increase/decrease depending on the strength of the magnon-photon coupling and the detuning parameters. We further show that the amount of correlations between the magnon and phonon modes is linked to the irreversibility generated in the system for small magnon-photon coupling. Our results demonstrate the possibility of exploring irreversibility in driven magnon-based hybrid quantum systems and open a promising route for quantum thermal applications.},

   abstract = {We propose a scheme to enhance the sensitivity of non-Hermitian optomechanical mass sensors. The benchmark system consists of two coupled optomechanical systems where the mechanical resonators are mechanically coupled. The optical cavities are driven either by a blue-detuned or red-detuned laser to produce gain and loss, respectively. Moreover, the mechanical resonators are parametrically driven through the modulation of their spring constant. For a specific strength of the optical driving field and without parametric driving, the system features an exceptional point (EP). Any perturbation to the mechanical frequency (dissipation) induces a splitting (shifting) of the EP, which scales as the square root of the perturbation strength, resulting in a sensitivity-factor enhancement compared with conventional optomechanical sensors. The sensitivity enhancement induced by the shifting scenario is weak as compared to the one based on the splitting phenomenon. By switching on parametric driving, the sensitivity of both sensing schemes is greatly improved, yielding to a better performance of the sensor. We have also confirmed these results through an analysis of the output spectra and the transmissions of the optical cavities. In addition to enhancing EP sensitivity, our scheme also reveals nonlinear effects on sensing under splitting and shifting scenarios. This work sheds light on mechanisms of enhancing the sensitivity of non-Hermitian mass sensors, paving a way to improve sensors performance for better nanoparticles or pollutants detection and for water treatment.},

   abstract = {In this manuscript, we highlight a new phenomenon of complex algebraic singularities formation for solutions of a large class of genuinely nonlinear Partial Differential Equations (PDEs). We start from a unique Cauchy datum which is holomorphic ramified like x11/(k + 1)<\sup> (and its powers) around the smooth locus x1 = 0 and is sufficiently singular. Then, we expect the existence of a solution which should be holomorphic ramified around the singular locus S defined by the vanishing of the discriminant of an algebraic equation of degree k + 1. Notice, moreover, that the monodromy of the Cauchy datum is Abelian, whereas one of the solutions is non-Abelian and that S depends on the Cauchy datum in contrast to the Leray principle (stated for linear problems only). This phenomenon is due to the fact that the PDE is genuinely nonlinear and that the Cauchy datum is sufficiently singular. First, we investigate the case of the inviscid Burgers Equation (iBE). Later, we state a general Conjecture 9.2, which describes the expected phenomenon. We view this Conjecture 9.2 as a working programme allowing us to develop interesting new Mathematics. We also state Conjecture 7.1, which is a particular case of the general Conjecture 9.2 but keeps all the flavour and difficulty of the subject. Then, we propose a new algorithm with a map F such that a fixed point of F would give a solution to the problem associated with Conjecture 7.1. Then, we perform convincing, elaborate numerical tests which suggest that a Banach norm shouldexist for which the mapping F should be a contraction so that the solution (with the above specific algebraic structure) should be unique.},

Our results reveal the existence of purely imaginary QNMs that were not identified in previous studies, suggesting potential (in)stabilities as the ratio of the Schwarzschild radius to the wormhole throat varies within a specific range. For scalar perturbations, instabilities arise when this ratio exceeds 1.0, with the threshold value of 1.0 itself included. In the case of axial perturbations, the onset of instability occurs at smaller ratios, reflecting the impact of gravitational waves on the wormhole’s stability. The findings suggest that the wormhole remains stable when the throat size significantly exceeds the Schwarzschild radius. Our results align with existing literature but offer new insights into the stability conditions of phantom wormholes.},

   abstract = {We investigate the quasi-normal modes (QNMs) of non-commutative geometry-inspired dirty black holes, focusing on both non-extremal and extremal configurations. These gravitational objects, characterized by smeared energy distributions within a modified de Sitter-like equation of state, modify the classical Schwarzschild metric and regularize central singularities. We employ a spectral method based on Chebyshev polynomials to solve the eigenvalue problem for scalar, electromagnetic and gravitational perturbations. Our results reveal new overdamped modes indicative of rapid decay without oscillation, particularly prominent in near-extremal and extremal regimes. In addition, we establish that the QNMs converge to classical Schwarzschild values for large mass parameters, validating our method’s robustness. Our findings highlight the impact of dirtiness and non-commutative effects on black hole QNM spectra, offering potential observational signatures for distinguishing these objects in gravitational-wave detections.},

   abstract = {Strike‐slip faults in lacustrine environments present overlooked tsunamigenic potential. For the first time, we have reconstructed paleotsunamis triggered by strike‐slip faulting with a dip‐slip component that ruptured the lake floor. This study focuses on Lake Iznik (Türkiye), located along the middle strand of the North Anatolian Fault (MNAF). We modeled tsunami generation, propagation, and inundation for the 121 CE (Mw ∼7.3) and 1065 CE (Mw ∼6.9) earthquakes using a coupled coseismic dislocation and hydrodynamic model. Simulated run‐ups and inundation distances are validated against coastal tsunami deposits. Our results show maximum run‐ups of ∼3 m for the 121 CE event and ∼1 m for the 1065 CE event, highlighting the tsunami hazard to the lakeshore. We also demonstrate that the tsunami generated during the 1065 CE event lacked sufficient wave height (&lt;0.5 m) to damage the newly discovered submerged Byzantine basilica. These findings emphasize the need to integrate tsunami risk into seismic hazard assessments for lacustrine strike‐slip fault zones.},

@article{Deeb2025,
   abstract = {This manuscript introduces an advanced numerical approach for the integration of incompressible Navier-Stokes (NS) equations using a Time Series Expansion (TSE) method within a Finite Element Method (FEM) framework. The technique is enhanced by a novel stabilization strategy, incorporating a Divergent Series Resummation (DSR) technique, which significantly augments the computational efficiency of the algorithm. The stabilization mechanism is meticulously designed to improve the stability and validity of computed series terms, enabling the application of the Factorial Series (FS) algorithm for series resummation. This approach is pivotal in addressing the challenges associated with the accurate and stable numerical solution of NS equations, which are critical in Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) applications. The manuscript elaborates on the variational formulation of Stokes problem and present convergence analysis of the method using the Ladyzhenskaya–Babuvska–Brezzi (LBB) condition. It is followed by the NS equations and the implementation details of the stabilization technique, underscored by numerical tests on laminar flow past a cylinder, showcasing the method’s efficacy and potential for broad applicability in fluid dynamics simulations. The results of the stabilization indicate a substantial enhancement in computational stability and accuracy, offering a promising avenue for future research in the field.},

@article{Deeb2024,
   abstract = {Over the past decade, Finite Element Method (FEM) has served as a foundational numerical framework for approximating the terms of Time‐Series Expansion (TSE) as solutions to transient Partial Differential Equation (PDE). However, the application of high‐order Finite Element (FE) to certain classes of PDEs, such as diffusion equations and the Navier–Stokes (NS) equations, often leads to numerical instabilities. These instabilities limit the number of valid terms in the series, though the efficiency of time‐series integration even when resummation techniques like the Borel–Padé–Laplace (BPL) integrators are employed. In this study, we introduce a novel variational formulation for computing the terms of a TSE associated with a given PDE using higher‐order FEs. Our approach involves the incorporation of artificial diffusion terms on the left‐hand side of the equations corresponding to each power in the series, serving as a stabilization technique. We demonstrate that this method can be interpreted as a minimization of an energy functional, wherein the total variations of the unknowns are considered. Furthermore, we establish that the coefficients of the artificial diffusion for each term in the series obey a recurrence relation, which can be determined by minimizing the condition number of the associated linear system. We highlight the link between the proposed technique and the Discrete Maximum Principle (DMP) of the heat equation. We show, via numerical experiments, how the proposed technique allows having additional valid terms of the series that will be substantial in enlarging the stability domain of the BPL integrators.},

@article{Rashidi2024,
   abstract = {The Makran Subduction Zone (MSZ), located in the northwestern Indian Ocean, is a region with significant tsunami hazard potential due to its tectonic setting and history of seismic activity. While megathrust earthquakes have traditionally been regarded as the primary source of tsunamis in this region, recent research indicates that tsunamis can also be generated by a variety of other mechanisms. These include seismic events from local normal and splay faults, as well as non-seismic processes such as submarine landslides, and meteorological phenomena, collectively referred to as "Non-Seismic and Complex Source Tsunamis." The recognition of these diverse tsunami-generating mechanisms has positioned the MSZ as a critical area of study, attracting considerable scientific attention over the past two decades. Researchers have focused on understanding the historical and paleotsunami records, identifying tsunamigenic sources, and advancing tsunami numerical modeling and hazard assessment techniques specific to the Makran region. This paper reviews the latest developments in tsunami research related to the MSZ, with a particular emphasis on Non-Seismic and Complex Source Tsunamis and the associated challenges in accurately assessing tsunami hazards in this tectonically complex region.},

   abstract = {CANWA (Comparative Analytical Numerical Wave Algorithm), written in MATLAB, provides a fast, direct comparison of a general finite volume solution to the 1+1 shallow water wave equations with a robust analytical solution recently presented by Nicolsky et al. (2018). The implementation of the method for data projection, introduced in Nicolsky et al. (2018), solves the initial value problem produced by the Carrier-Greenspan transformation, allows for highly accurate simulations of waves with nonzero initial velocities. Additionally, an analysis of error grants a comparison of solutions across the entire spatial domain. Simulations of both solitary and N-waves reveal that the numerical method consistently yields larger inundation zones than the analytical solution.},
